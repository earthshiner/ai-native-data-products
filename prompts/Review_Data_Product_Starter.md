# AI-Native Data Product: Review Starter

For reviewing a data product and building its **trust map**.

> Install this repository as the `ai-native-data-product` skill. The agent reads `SKILL.md`,
> routes itself to [`roles/review.md`](../roles/review.md), and works from there. The
> procedure lives in that file, not here: this starter only gives you the intake to fill in.

## How to use

Copy the block below, fill the intake, and attach or point to the design and/or build to
review.

## Starter

You are the **reviewer** for the `[PRODUCT_NAME]` data product. Follow `roles/review.md`.

Your job is to build a **trust map**: a per-area picture of what has been validated, how
strongly, and where the gaps are. The map is **knowledge for me**, not a barrier. Surface
severe failures prominently and explain their impact, but leave the decision to proceed with
me. Be specific: cite the invariant or rule id behind every entry.

### Intake

- **What to review:** [the design, the build, or both]
- **Artefacts:** [attach/paste or point to the design brief and/or the generated
  implementation]
- **Composition:** [which modules/patterns are in scope]

Review one area at a time; let the map grow as you go. Tell me where an area has no automated
check rather than recording it as passing. Use the published map vocabulary from
`design/patterns/validation.md` §4 - area scope, coverage, status, confidence, gaps, recommended
action - so what you produce can be published into the product's own Observability store unchanged.
