## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of This Document

This document provides **Teradata's recommended practices** for data management in AI-Native Data Products. These are **advocated approaches** based on 30+ years of enterprise data management experience, not mandatory requirements.

**Key Principle**: The Domain Module Design Standard defines STRUCTURE; this document advocates IMPLEMENTATION CHOICES.

### 1.2 How to Use This Guidance

| Your Situation | How to Apply |
| --- | --- |
| **Starting fresh** | Adopt these practices as defaults |
| **Existing patterns** | Evaluate selective adoption |
| **Specific constraints** | Adapt patterns to your context |
| **Different philosophy** | Document your alternative approach |


### 1.3 Advocacy vs Mandate

| This Document ADVOCATES | Design Standard MANDATES |
| --- | --- |
| Bi-temporal tracking | Module structure |
| Surrogate keys | Naming conventions |
| Soft deletes | Cross-module integration patterns |
| Observability offload | Agent discoverability |
| TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE | View standards |
| Column optimization | - |


**Remember**: You can build AI-Native data products using different temporal patterns, different key strategies, or different column approaches—as long as you follow the structural patterns in the Design Standard.

## 2. Bi-Temporal Data Management

### 2.1 Why We Advocate Bi-Temporal

**Traditional Approach**: Type 2 SCD (single time dimension) **Advocated Approach**: Bi-temporal (two independent time dimensions)

#### Key Benefits for AI-Native Data Products

| Requirement | Type 2 SCD | Bi-Temporal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Point-in-time correctness** | ⚠️ Approximate | ✅ Exact |
| **Late-arriving facts** | ❌ Corrupts history | ✅ Preserves history |
| **Corrections tracking** | ❌ Lost | ✅ Traceable |
| **ML feature accuracy** | ⚠️ May be wrong | ✅ Guaranteed correct |
| **Audit trail** | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Complete |
| **Explainability** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Full reconstruction |


### 2.2 The Two Time Dimensions

    Example: Customer changes name from "Jane Doe" to "Jane Smith"

    Real World Event:
    - Marriage happens on 2024-06-15 (Valid Time)

    Database Recording:
    - We learn about it on 2024-07-01 (Transaction Time)

    Bi-Temporal Record:
    - valid_from_dts = 2024-06-15 (when it became true in reality)
    - transaction_from_dts = 2024-07-01 (when we recorded it)

**Valid Time**: When the fact was TRUE in the real world **Transaction Time**: When the fact was RECORDED in the database

### 2.3 Advocated Bi-Temporal Column Set

    -- ADVOCATED: Bi-temporal columns
    valid_from_dts      TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
        COMMENT 'When this version became true in real world',

    valid_to_dts        TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
        DEFAULT TIMESTAMP '9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999+00:00'
        COMMENT 'When this version stopped being true in real world',

    transaction_from_dts TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
        DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6)
        COMMENT 'When this version was inserted into database',

    transaction_to_dts   TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
        DEFAULT TIMESTAMP '9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999+00:00'
        COMMENT 'When this version was superseded in database',

    is_current  BYTEINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
        COMMENT '1 = Current version, 0 = Historical version',

**IMPORTANT: PRIMARY INDEX for Temporal Tables**

Temporal tables (bi-temporal, Type 2 SCD, versioned) should use **PRIMARY INDEX** (NUPI), not UNIQUE PRIMARY INDEX, because:

- Multiple versions exist for the same entity_id
- Historical records create natural duplicates
- UNIQUE PRIMARY INDEX would prevent version updates


    -- CORRECT for temporal tables
    CREATE TABLE Party_H (
        party_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
        -- ... bi-temporal columns ...
    )
    PRIMARY INDEX (party_id);  -- NUPI allows multiple versions

    -- INCORRECT for temporal tables
    CREATE TABLE Party_H (
        party_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
        -- ... bi-temporal columns ...
    )
    UNIQUE PRIMARY INDEX (party_id);  -- Would fail on version 2

**Use UNIQUE PRIMARY INDEX only for:**

- Non-temporal tables (no versioning)
- Reference data with unique codes
- Tables where each key appears exactly once


### 2.4 Bi-Temporal Operations

#### Insert New Entity (Version 1)

    INSERT INTO Party_H (
        party_id, party_key, legal_name,
        valid_from_dts, valid_to_dts,
        transaction_from_dts, transaction_to_dts,
        is_current, is_deleted
    ) VALUES (
        1001, 'CUST-12345', 'Jane Doe',
        TIMESTAMP '2024-01-01 00:00:00+00:00',
        TIMESTAMP '9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999+00:00',
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6),
        TIMESTAMP '9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999+00:00',
        1, 0
    );

#### Update Entity (Create Version 2)

    -- Step 1: Close out current version
    UPDATE Party_H
    SET valid_to_dts = TIMESTAMP '2024-06-15 00:00:00+00:00',
        transaction_to_dts = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6),
        is_current = 0
    WHERE party_id = 1001 AND is_current = 1;

    -- Step 2: Insert new version
    INSERT INTO Party_H (
        party_id, party_key, legal_name,
        valid_from_dts, valid_to_dts,
        transaction_from_dts, transaction_to_dts,
        is_current, is_deleted
    ) VALUES (
        1001, 'CUST-12345', 'Jane Smith',  -- NAME CHANGED
        TIMESTAMP '2024-06-15 00:00:00+00:00',  -- When change occurred
        TIMESTAMP '9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999+00:00',
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6),  -- When we recorded it
        TIMESTAMP '9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999+00:00',
        1, 0
    );

#### Correct Historical Data (Late-Arriving Fact)

    -- Scenario: Discovered marriage actually happened on 2024-06-10, not 2024-06-15
    -- We need to correct valid_from_dts but preserve transaction history

    -- Step 1: Close incorrect version in transaction time
    UPDATE Party_H
    SET transaction_to_dts = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6),
        is_current = 0
    WHERE party_id = 1001
      AND valid_from_dts = TIMESTAMP '2024-06-15 00:00:00+00:00'
      AND is_current = 1;

    -- Step 2: Insert corrected version with new transaction time
    INSERT INTO Party_H (
        party_id, party_key, legal_name,
        valid_from_dts, valid_to_dts,
        transaction_from_dts, transaction_to_dts,
        is_current, is_deleted
    ) VALUES (
        1001, 'CUST-12345', 'Jane Smith',
        TIMESTAMP '2024-06-10 00:00:00+00:00',  -- CORRECTED valid time
        TIMESTAMP '9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999+00:00',
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6),  -- NEW transaction time
        TIMESTAMP '9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999+00:00',
        1, 0
    );

    -- Result: Complete history preserved
    -- - What we thought (2024-06-15) - closed in transaction time
    -- - What actually happened (2024-06-10) - current

### 2.5 Advocated Query Patterns

#### Get Current State

    SELECT party_id, party_key, legal_name
    FROM Party_H
    WHERE party_key = 'CUST-12345'
      AND is_current = 1
      AND is_deleted = 0;

#### Point-in-Time Query (for ML Features)

    -- "What was the customer's name on 2024-05-01?"
    -- Critical for computing features with temporal correctness
    SELECT party_id, party_key, legal_name
    FROM Party_H
    WHERE party_key = 'CUST-12345'
      AND TIMESTAMP '2024-05-01 00:00:00+00:00' >= valid_from_dts
      AND TIMESTAMP '2024-05-01 00:00:00+00:00' < valid_to_dts
      AND is_deleted = 0
      AND transaction_from_dts = (
          SELECT MAX(transaction_from_dts)
          FROM Party_H p2
          WHERE p2.party_id = Party_H.party_id
            AND p2.transaction_from_dts <= TIMESTAMP '2024-05-01 23:59:59.999999+00:00'
      );

#### As-Of Query (Transaction Time)

    -- "What did our database show on 2024-07-15 (before correction)?"
    SELECT party_id, party_key, legal_name
    FROM Party_H
    WHERE party_key = 'CUST-12345'
      AND transaction_from_dts <= TIMESTAMP '2024-07-15 23:59:59.999999+00:00'
      AND transaction_to_dts > TIMESTAMP '2024-07-15 23:59:59.999999+00:00';

### 2.6 Alternative: Type 2 SCD (When Acceptable)

**Use Type 2 SCD instead of bi-temporal when:**

- Late-arriving facts are extremely rare
- Corrections are not needed
- ML features don't require point-in-time correctness
- Simpler is better for your use case


    -- Type 2 SCD (simpler temporal)
    CREATE TABLE Party_H (
        party_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
        party_key VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        effective_date DATE NOT NULL,
        expiration_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT DATE '9999-12-31',
        is_current BYTEINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
        -- ... other columns ...
    );

**Trade-off**: Simpler implementation, but loses ability to handle corrections and lacks transaction-time dimension.

## 3. Column Optimization Strategy

### 3.1 The Column Overhead Challenge

**Traditional Standards**: 20+ standard columns per table **Problem**: Significant overhead on high-volume tables **Advocated Solution**: Three-tier approach

### 3.2 Three-Tier Column Strategy

#### Tier 1: Core Columns (Always Include)

**Minimum viable set for AI-Native domain tables:**

    {entity}_id        BIGINT NOT NULL             -- Surrogate key
    {entity}_key       VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL        -- Natural key
    valid_from_dts      TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
    valid_to_dts        TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
    transaction_from_dts TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
    transaction_to_dts   TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
    is_current  BYTEINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
    is_deleted          BYTEINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0

**Total: 8 columns**

#### Tier 2: Extended Columns (Add When Justified)

    -- Version tracking (if humans need it)
    version_number      INTEGER

    -- ID type (if multiple identifier types exist)
    {entity}_id_type    VARCHAR(20)

    -- Direct references to Observability (for performance)
    change_event_id    BIGINT  -- FK to Observability.ChangeEvent_H
    lineage_id         BIGINT  -- FK to Observability.DataLineage_H
    quality_id        BIGINT  -- FK to Observability.DataQuality_H

    -- Change detection (if needed in ETL)
    record_hash         VARCHAR(64)

**Add selectively based on need**

#### Tier 3: Offload to Observability (Recommended)

    -- Instead of in Domain table:
    created_by, updated_by, deleted_by, deleted_reason
    source_system, source_record_id, batch_id
    data_quality_score, quality_rule_failures

    -- Store in Observability module:
    Observability.ChangeEvent_H    -- Who, when, why
    Observability.DataLineage_H    -- Source tracking
    Observability.DataQuality_H    -- Quality time-series

### 3.3 Column Overhead Comparison

| Approach | Columns | Storage Impact | Join Needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Core Only** | 8 | Minimal | Yes (via views) |
| **Core + FK Refs** | 11 | Low | Yes (but fast) |
| **Core + Extended** | 15-20 | Medium | Sometimes |
| **Traditional (all in Domain)** | 20-25 | High | No |


### 3.4 Advocated Approach by Table Volume

| Table Volume | Advocated Approach | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **< 10M rows** | Core + Extended OK | Storage overhead acceptable |
| **10M - 100M rows** | Core + FK Refs | Balance performance and storage |
| **> 100M rows** | Core Only + Views | Minimize overhead |
| **Reference tables** | Core + Extended OK | Small, low-volume |

---

## 4. Surrogate Key Strategy

### 4.1 Why We Advocate Surrogate Keys

**Advocated**: System-generated BIGINT surrogate keys **Alternative**: Natural keys as primary identifier

#### Benefits of Surrogate Keys

| Benefit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Stability** | Never changes, even if natural key changes |
| **Performance** | BIGINT joins faster than VARCHAR |
| **Simplicity** | Single column vs composite natural keys |
| **Universality** | Works for all entity types |
| **Cross-module** | Consistent FK pattern |


### 4.2 Surrogate Key Stability in History Tables

In SCD Type 2 history tables, multiple rows exist for the same real-world entity —
one row per version. It is therefore best practice to **allocate surrogate keys
separately from the history table itself**, so that the same surrogate value is
consistently used across all versions of an entity.

This matters because other tables — transaction history, product holdings, prediction
outputs, cross-module joins — hold FK references to the entity's surrogate. If the
surrogate changes between versions, those FK references become ambiguous: which
version's value should be stored?

    Illustrative example: Customer 'CUST-12345' with 3 SCD versions
      Version 1 → party_id = 1
      Version 2 → party_id = 1   ← same surrogate (correct — separate allocation)
      Version 3 → party_id = 1   ← same surrogate (correct — separate allocation)

      A transaction table holding party_id = 1 unambiguously identifies the customer
      regardless of which version is current.

When surrogate allocation is managed separately, cross-module FK joins are stable
and unambiguous regardless of how many SCD versions exist for an entity.

### 4.3 Recommended Approach: The Keymap Pattern

The Keymap pattern is the approach recommended in this document. If your organisation
already has an established surrogate key allocation strategy — such as a central
sequence service, a UUID generator, or an enterprise key management framework — that
existing standard should be used in preference to the Keymap pattern described here.
The requirement from the Domain Module Design Standard is simply that surrogate keys
are **stable across SCD versions**; the mechanism for achieving that stability is a
designer choice.

If adopting the Keymap pattern, the following templates apply.

#### Keymap Table DDL

    -- One row per unique real-world entity.
    -- IDENTITY fires here once per natural key — never on the _H table.
    CREATE TABLE {ProductName}_Domain.{Entity}_Keymap (
        {entity}_id   BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY NOT NULL,
        {entity}_key  VARCHAR(50) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC NOT NULL,
        source_system VARCHAR(50) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC,
        created_dts   TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6)
    )
    UNIQUE PRIMARY INDEX ({entity}_key);  -- UNIQUE PI: one row per natural key

    COMMENT ON TABLE {ProductName}_Domain.{Entity}_Keymap IS
    'Keymap: one row per unique {entity}. Surrogate key (IDENTITY) generated here
    and referenced by {Entity}_H and all cross-domain FK columns. Natural key is
    {entity}_key from the source system.';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN {ProductName}_Domain.{Entity}_Keymap.{entity}_id IS
    'Surrogate key - generated exactly once per real-world entity. Stable across
    all SCD versions in {Entity}_H and across all modules that reference this entity.';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN {ProductName}_Domain.{Entity}_Keymap.{entity}_key IS
    'Natural business key from the source system - used to look up the stable surrogate.';

#### History Table DDL

    -- {entity}_id is BIGINT NOT NULL — populated from the keymap (or equivalent
    -- allocation mechanism) via JOIN. Never generated directly on this table.
    -- Multiple rows with the same {entity}_id will exist (one per SCD version).
    -- PRIMARY INDEX (non-unique) co-locates all versions on the same AMP,
    -- making expire-and-insert SCD operations efficient.
    CREATE TABLE {ProductName}_Domain.{Entity}_H (
        {entity}_id   BIGINT NOT NULL,         -- from Keymap — stable across versions
        {entity}_key  VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,    -- natural key repeated for convenience
        -- ... temporal and business columns ...
        PRIMARY INDEX ({entity}_id)            -- NUPI: multiple versions allowed
    );

    COMMENT ON COLUMN {ProductName}_Domain.{Entity}_H.{entity}_id IS
    'Surrogate key - allocated via surrogate key allocation strategy (see Advocated
    Data Management Standards Section 4). Stable across all SCD versions for the
    same real-world entity. Never generated directly on this table.';

#### Two-Step Load Pattern (Keymap approach)

    -- Step 1: Register any new natural keys (idempotent — WHERE NOT EXISTS)
    INSERT INTO {ProductName}_Domain.{Entity}_Keymap ({entity}_key, source_system)
    SELECT DISTINCT TRIM(s.NATURAL_KEY_COLUMN), 'SOURCE_SYSTEM_NAME'
    FROM {source_table} s
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM {ProductName}_Domain.{Entity}_Keymap k
        WHERE k.{entity}_key = TRIM(s.NATURAL_KEY_COLUMN)
    );

    -- Step 2: Populate history table using keymap JOIN
    INSERT INTO {ProductName}_Domain.{Entity}_H (
        {entity}_id, {entity}_key, /* business columns */,
        valid_from_dts, valid_to_dts, is_current, is_deleted
    )
    SELECT
        k.{entity}_id,               -- stable surrogate from keymap
        TRIM(s.NATURAL_KEY_COLUMN),
        /* business columns */,
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6), TIMESTAMP '9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999+00:00', 1, 0
    FROM {source_table}                              s
    JOIN {ProductName}_Domain.{Entity}_Keymap        k
        ON k.{entity}_key = TRIM(s.NATURAL_KEY_COLUMN);

#### Cross-Entity Foreign Keys

Regardless of the surrogate key allocation mechanism chosen, all FK references
between domain entities should point to the **stable surrogate**, not to a specific
row in the `_H` table, to ensure FK joins are unambiguous across SCD versions.

    -- FK columns in other entities reference the stable surrogate
    CREATE TABLE {ProductName}_Domain.Order_H (
        order_id    BIGINT NOT NULL,
        party_id    BIGINT,     -- FK to Party stable surrogate (e.g. via Party_Keymap)
        product_id  BIGINT,     -- FK to Product stable surrogate
        -- ...
    );

### 4.4 Reference and Lookup Table Exemption

The surrogate key stability requirement applies to entities whose surrogate is **referenced as a foreign key by other tables**. Reference and lookup tables, as
well as detail/child entities that are never themselves FK-referenced, do not need a
separate allocation mechanism — a simple IDENTITY column directly on the `_H` table
is sufficient, since no external table holds a reference to their surrogate across
SCD versions.

    Stable allocation required           Simple IDENTITY on _H acceptable
    ----------------------------------   ------------------------------------------
    Party   (FK target of Order)         Reference tables  (e.g. LoanPurpose_R)
    Order   (FK target of LineItem)      Lookup tables     (e.g. StatusCode_R)
    Product (FK target of Order)         Detail/child entities with no FK dependants
                                         (e.g. CustomerContact, PropertyRisk)

**Rule**: Does any other table hold a FK column pointing to this entity's surrogate?

- YES → A surrogate allocation strategy is recommended to ensure FK stability across SCD versions
- NO → Simple IDENTITY on `_H` is sufficient


### 4.5 Surrogate Key Allocation Decision Tree

    START: Is this entity's surrogate referenced as a FK by any other table?
    |
    +-- YES --> Surrogate allocation strategy required
    |           Options (choose one):
    |           a) Keymap pattern (recommended in this document)
    |           b) Organisation's existing central key allocation standard
    |           c) Database sequence with natural key constraint on _H
    |           Key principle: the surrogate must be stable across SCD versions
    |
    +-- NO  --> Reference/lookup table or detail entity: IDENTITY on _H is acceptable
                - {entity}_id = BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY on _H
                - Single-step INSERT; no prior allocation step needed
                - Document explicitly that this entity is not a FK target

### 4.6 When Natural Keys Are Acceptable as the Surrogate

**Use natural key as surrogate when:**

- Natural key is truly immutable
- Natural key is single column
- Natural key is numeric (not VARCHAR)
- Business strongly prefers it


**Example**: Product SKU that never changes

    CREATE TABLE Product_H (
        product_id BIGINT NOT NULL,  -- Still use surrogate internally
        sku        VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
        -- ...
        PRIMARY INDEX (product_id)
    );

## 5. Soft Delete Pattern

### 5.1 Why We Advocate Soft Deletes

**Hard Delete**: `DELETE FROM Party_H WHERE party_id = 1001` **Soft Delete**: `UPDATE Party_H SET is_deleted = 1 WHERE party_id = 1001`

#### Benefits for AI-Native Data Products

| Benefit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Audit trail** | Complete history preserved |
| **Explainability** | "Why did model predict X?" requires historical state |
| **Regulatory compliance** | GDPR, CCPA require audit trails |
| **Reversibility** | Accidental deletes recoverable |
| **Analytics** | Churn analysis, deletion patterns |
| **ML features** | "Was customer deleted" is a feature |


### 5.2 Advocated Soft Delete Implementation

    -- Core column
    is_deleted BYTEINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
        COMMENT '0 = Active, 1 = Soft deleted'

    -- Optional: Store deletion details in Domain table
    deleted_by VARCHAR(100)
        COMMENT 'User/system that soft deleted this record'
    deleted_dts TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE
        COMMENT 'When this record was soft deleted'
    deleted_reason VARCHAR(500)
        COMMENT 'Reason for soft delete (GDPR, data quality, etc.)'

    -- Better: Store deletion details in Observability
    -- (see Section 7)

### 5.3 Soft Delete Operation

    -- Step 1: Close out current version
    UPDATE Party_H
    SET valid_to_dts = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6),
        transaction_to_dts = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6),
        is_current = 0
    WHERE party_id = 1001
      AND is_current = 1;

    -- Step 2: Insert soft-deleted version
    INSERT INTO Party_H (
        party_id, party_key, legal_name,
        valid_from_dts, valid_to_dts,
        transaction_from_dts, transaction_to_dts,
        is_current, is_deleted
    ) VALUES (
        1001, 'CUST-12345', 'Jane Smith',
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6),  -- Deleted as of now
        TIMESTAMP '9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999+00:00',
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6),
        TIMESTAMP '9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999+00:00',
        1,  -- is_current = 1 (this IS the current state: deleted)
        1   -- is_deleted = 1
    );

    -- Track deletion details in Observability
    INSERT INTO Observability.ChangeEvent_H (
        entity_type, entity_id, change_type,
        changed_by, changed_dts, change_reason
    ) VALUES (
        'PARTY', 1001, 'DELETE',
        'DELETE_PROCESS', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6), 'GDPR Right to be Forgotten'
    );

### 5.4 Querying with Soft Deletes

    -- Current active records only (most common)
    SELECT * FROM Party_H
    WHERE is_current = 1
      AND is_deleted = 0;

    -- Include deleted records
    SELECT * FROM Party_H
    WHERE is_current = 1;

    -- Only deleted records
    SELECT * FROM Party_H
    WHERE is_current = 1
      AND is_deleted = 1;

### 5.5 When Hard Deletes Are Acceptable

**Use hard deletes when:**

- No regulatory audit requirement
- No ML feature dependency
- No analytics on deletion patterns
- Storage constraints are critical
- Data truly has no future value


**Example**: Temporary staging data, test data

## 6. Access Layer

### 6.1 Why We Advocate Reading Through Views

**Traditional Approach**: Consumers — analysts, applications, BI
tools, agents — read tables directly, managing lock posture and
column projection in every query.

**Advocated Approach**: Tables are not the consumer surface.
Every table that is read by anything other than its load process
and DBAs is fronted by a view. Consumers read the view; the table
is private.

#### Key Benefits for AI-Native Data Products

| Concern                        | Direct table reads          | Read through views      |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Concurrent loads**           | ⚠️ Read can block load      | ✅ Read is non-blocking |
| **Lock posture consistency**   | ⚠️ Per-query, easy to omit  | ✅ Centralised in view  |
| **Agent discoverability**      | ⚠️ Physical schema exposed  | ✅ Stable contract      |
| **Permission management**      | ⚠️ Coupled to physical      | ✅ Decoupled            |
| **Refactoring physical layer** | ❌ Breaks every consumer    | ✅ View absorbs change  |
| **Schema documentation**       | ⚠️ Scattered                | ✅ Co-located in view   |

The view layer is the **stable contract** between physical data
and every consumer. As long as the contract holds, the underlying
table can be re-partitioned, re-indexed, re-located, or
re-modelled without breaking a single consumer. For AI-Native
Data Products specifically, this stability is what allows an
agent to learn a data product once and continue to operate
correctly as its physical implementation evolves.

### 6.2 Defer to the Object Placement Standard

This document is deliberately silent on **where** tables and
views are placed, **how** containers are named, and **how**
access is granted across them. Those decisions are governed by a
separate, layered standards system:

| Document                                                | Role                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Object Placement Standard — Interface Specification** | Platform-agnostic contract. Defines the eight required sections any conforming placement standard must declare. |
| **Object Placement Standard — Platform Implementation** | A conforming implementation for a specific platform (e.g. Teradata). Declares concrete naming, separation, view-tier architecture, access model, and validation procedure. |

This document **advocates** access through views. The Object
Placement Standard **prescribes** how that access is structured
on a given platform. The split is intentional:

- **Different organisations have different conventions.** Some
  separate tables and views into distinct containers; some
  co-locate them; some apply a layered zone model. All can be
  conformant.
- **The agent contract must be portable.** An AI-Native Data
  Product agent reads a conforming Object Placement Standard
  before generating any DDL. It does not assume — it reads, it
  derives, it validates. The contract is the same shape on every
  platform; the implementation differs.
- **This document advocates patterns; the Object Placement
  Standard prescribes structure.** Conflating the two would force
  every reader to either adopt a single naming convention or
  rewrite parts of this document — neither of which is
  appropriate for an advocacy document.

#### Agent and Builder Behaviour

A data product builder, or an agent generating DDL within a data
product, **must locate a conforming Object Placement Standard
implementation before generating any object**. The Interface
Specification defines the priority order for locating it:

1. An explicit file path provided in conversation or project
   instructions
2. A skill file at a well-known path (e.g.
   `/mnt/skills/user/object-placement/SKILL.md`)
3. A file matching `Object_Placement_Standard*.md` in project
   context
4. **If none are present:** halt and ask the user

A builder must never default to a placement convention,
substitute its own assumption, or fall back to "the most common
pattern". If the standard is absent, the correct response is to
ask, not to guess.

### 6.3 What This Document Continues to Cover

The Object Placement Standard governs container structure,
naming, separation, and access. This document continues to
advocate **logical patterns** that are independent of placement:

- Bi-temporal columns and their semantics (Section 2)
- Column tiering and offload to Observability (Section 3)
- Surrogate key strategy and the Keymap pattern (Section 4)
- Soft-delete semantics (Section 5)
- Observability offload pattern (Section 7)
- Timezone handling (Section 8)
- Data quality scoring (Section 9)
- Audit trail strategy (Section 10)

These patterns are **expressed in DDL** that the Object Placement
Standard then places into the appropriate containers. The two
standards compose: this document advocates *what* a `Customer_H`
table contains; the Object Placement Standard determines *which
container* `Customer_H` and its fronting view are placed in, what
they are named, and how they are accessed.

#### Worked Example of the Composition

A `Customer_H` table designed under this document has bi-temporal
columns (Section 2), a stable surrogate from a Keymap (Section
4), and a soft-delete flag (Section 5). The Object Placement
Standard then determines:

- The container the table is placed in (e.g. a strict-separation
  Teradata implementation places it in a `_T` container)
- The container the fronting locking view is placed in (e.g. the
  matching `_V` container under strict separation, or the same
  container under co-location)
- The exact name of each container, derived from the standard's
  `derive_container()` function
- The access grants and any implied grants required by the
  separation architecture
- The validation procedure that confirms placement after
  deployment

Neither document is complete on its own. Together they describe a
fully-specified data product.

### 6.4 Why This Is Agent-Friendly

The split between *what to design* (this document) and *where to
place it* (the Object Placement Standard) is what makes the
combined system robust under agent operation. Three properties
follow:

**Portability across customers.** An agent that builds data
products for multiple customers does not carry hard-coded
placement assumptions. It carries a contract — read the
Placement Standard, call its derivation function, run its
validation procedure — and renders correctly into whatever
convention the customer has chosen.

**Stability under physical change.** A customer reorganising
their container hierarchy revises one document — their Object
Placement Standard. Every data product designed under this
document continues to apply unchanged.

**Independent evolution.** This document evolves as data
management practices evolve (new bi-temporal patterns, new
quality scoring approaches). Placement standards evolve as
platform capabilities evolve (new container types, new access
mechanisms). Neither blocks the other.

Implementations for other platforms (Snowflake, BigQuery,
Databricks, etc.) follow the same Interface Specification with
platform-appropriate constructs. Any organisation may author its
own conforming implementation that reflects local conventions.

## 7. Observability Offload Pattern

### 7.1 The Normalization Principle

**Problem**: Storing audit/lineage/quality data in Domain tables duplicates data across millions of rows

**Advocated Solution**: Store once in Observability module, join when needed

### 7.2 Observability Module Tables

#### ChangeEvent_H (Audit Trail)

    CREATE TABLE Observability.ChangeEvent_H (
        change_event_id     BIGINT NOT NULL,
        entity_type         VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- 'PARTY', 'PRODUCT', etc.
        entity_id          BIGINT NOT NULL,
        change_type         VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,  -- 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE'
        changed_by          VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
        changed_dts         TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
        change_reason       VARCHAR(500),
        changed_columns     VARCHAR(2000),  -- JSON array of changed columns
        old_values_json     JSON,
        new_values_json     JSON,
        PRIMARY INDEX (entity_id, changed_dts)
    )
    PARTITION BY RANGE_N(
        changed_dts BETWEEN DATE '2020-01-01' AND DATE '2030-12-31'
        EACH INTERVAL '1' MONTH
    );

#### DataLineage_H (Source Tracking)

    CREATE TABLE Observability.DataLineage_H (
        lineage_id         BIGINT NOT NULL,
        entity_type         VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        entity_id          BIGINT NOT NULL,
        source_system       VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        source_record_id    VARCHAR(100),
        batch_id            VARCHAR(50),
        loaded_dts          TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
        extraction_dts      TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE,
        transformation_name VARCHAR(128),
        lineage_metadata_json JSON,
        PRIMARY INDEX (entity_id)
    );

#### DataQuality_H (Quality Time-Series)

    CREATE TABLE Observability.DataQuality_H (
        quality_id         BIGINT NOT NULL,
        entity_type         VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        entity_id          BIGINT NOT NULL,
        evaluated_dts       TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
        quality_score       DECIMAL(3,2) NOT NULL,
        rule_results_json   JSON,  -- Array of {rule_id, passed, message}
        PRIMARY INDEX (entity_id, evaluated_dts)
    )
    PARTITION BY RANGE_N(
        evaluated_dts BETWEEN DATE '2024-01-01' AND DATE '2030-12-31'
        EACH INTERVAL '1' MONTH
    );

### 7.3 Two Join Approaches

#### Approach 1: Surrogate Key References (Fastest)

**Domain table includes FK to Observability:**

    CREATE TABLE Party_H (
        party_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
        -- ... core columns ...
  
        -- Optional: Direct references for performance
        change_event_id BIGINT,  -- FK to most recent ChangeEvent
        lineage_id BIGINT,       -- FK to current DataLineage
        quality_id BIGINT,       -- FK to latest DataQuality
  
        FOREIGN KEY (change_event_id)
            REFERENCES Observability.ChangeEvent_H(change_event_id),
        FOREIGN KEY (lineage_id)
            REFERENCES Observability.DataLineage_H(lineage_id),
        FOREIGN KEY (quality_id)
            REFERENCES Observability.DataQuality_H(quality_id)
    );

    -- Query: Fast direct join
    SELECT p.*, ce.changed_by, dl.source_system, dq.quality_score
    FROM Party_H p
    LEFT JOIN Observability.ChangeEvent_H ce
        ON ce.change_event_id = p.change_event_id
    LEFT JOIN Observability.DataLineage_H dl
        ON dl.lineage_id = p.lineage_id
    LEFT JOIN Observability.DataQuality_H dq
        ON dq.quality_id = p.quality_id
    WHERE p.is_current = 1;

**Overhead**: 3 BIGINT columns (24 bytes) vs 15+ columns (500+ bytes)

#### Approach 2: Join by entity_id (No FK Required)

**Domain table has NO FK, join on entity_id + entity_type:**

    CREATE TABLE Party_H (
        party_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
        -- ... core columns only (8 columns) ...
    );

    -- Query: Join by entity reference
    SELECT p.*, ce.changed_by, dl.source_system, dq.quality_score
    FROM Party_H p
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT entity_id, changed_by, changed_dts,
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY entity_id ORDER BY changed_dts DESC) AS rn
        FROM Observability.ChangeEvent_H
        WHERE entity_type = 'PARTY'
    ) ce ON ce.entity_id = p.party_id AND ce.rn = 1
    LEFT JOIN Observability.DataLineage_H dl
        ON dl.entity_type = 'PARTY' AND dl.entity_id = p.party_id
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT entity_id, quality_score, evaluated_dts,
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY entity_id ORDER BY evaluated_dts DESC) AS rn
        FROM Observability.DataQuality_H
        WHERE entity_type = 'PARTY'
    ) dq ON dq.entity_id = p.party_id AND dq.rn = 1
    WHERE p.is_current = 1;

**Overhead**: 0 additional columns, join on indexed columns

### 7.4 Pre-Joined Views for Agent Access

```sql
-- Create view to simplify agent queries
CREATE VIEW Party_Complete
(
    -- View contract: agents see all returned columns without parsing the SELECT body
    party_id,
    party_key,
    legal_name,
    valid_from_dts,
    valid_to_dts,
    last_changed_by,
    last_changed_dts,
    change_reason,
    source_system,
    batch_id,
    quality_score,
    quality_evaluated_dts
)
AS
SELECT 
    p.party_id, p.party_key, p.legal_name,
    p.valid_from_dts, p.valid_to_dts,
    ce.changed_by AS last_changed_by,
    ce.changed_dts AS last_changed_dts,
    ce.change_reason,
    dl.source_system,
    dl.batch_id,
    dq.quality_score,
    dq.evaluated_dts AS quality_evaluated_dts
FROM Party_H p
LEFT JOIN Observability.ChangeEvent_H ce 
    ON ce.change_event_id = p.change_event_id  -- If using FK approach
LEFT JOIN Observability.DataLineage_H dl 
    ON dl.lineage_id = p.lineage_id
LEFT JOIN Observability.DataQuality_H dq 
    ON dq.quality_id = p.quality_id
WHERE p.is_current = 1;

-- Agent query (simple)
SELECT * FROM Party_Complete WHERE party_key = 'CUST-12345';
```

### 7.5 Advocated Approach by Scenario

| Scenario | Recommended Approach |
| --- | --- |
| **High-volume tables (>100M rows)** | No FK, join by entity_id, use views |
| **Medium-volume (10M-100M)** | FK references for performance |
| **Low-volume (<10M)** | Either approach acceptable |
| **Agent-heavy workload** | Pre-joined views essential |
| **Storage-constrained** | No FK, offload everything |


### 7.6 Benefits Quantification

**Example: 50M row Party table**

| Approach | Domain Table Size | Join Performance | Complexity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Traditional (all in Domain)** | ~10 GB | N/A (no join) | Low |
| **Core + FK refs** | ~6 GB | Fast (direct FK) | Medium |
| **Core only + views** | ~4 GB | Fast (indexed) | Medium |


**Storage savings**: 40-60% while maintaining query performance

---

## 8. Timezone Handling

### 8.1 Why We Advocate TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE

**Problem**: Global enterprises operate across multiple timezones **Impact**: Temporal accuracy, regulatory compliance, cross-region analysis

### 8.2 Advocated Standard

**Always use `TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE` for all temporal columns**

    -- ADVOCATED
    valid_from_dts      TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
    valid_to_dts        TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
    transaction_from_dts TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
    transaction_to_dts   TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL

    -- NOT RECOMMENDED
    valid_from_dts      TIMESTAMP(6) NOT NULL  -- Missing timezone

### 8.3 Default Values with Timezone

    -- Always include timezone in defaults
    DEFAULT TIMESTAMP '9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999+00:00'  -- UTC

    -- NOT
    DEFAULT TIMESTAMP '9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999'  -- Ambiguous

### 8.4 Timezone Best Practices

| Practice | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| **Storage** | Always store in UTC (+00:00) |
| **Display** | Convert to user's local timezone in application |
| **Defaults** | Use UTC for all default timestamps |
| **Queries** | Include explicit timezone in literals |
| **Comparison** | Database handles timezone conversion automatically |


### 8.5 Query Examples with Timezone

    -- Correct: Explicit timezone
    SELECT * FROM Party_H
    WHERE valid_from_dts >= TIMESTAMP '2024-01-01 00:00:00+00:00'
      AND valid_from_dts < TIMESTAMP '2024-02-01 00:00:00+00:00';

    -- Also correct: Database will convert to UTC
    SELECT * FROM Party_H
    WHERE valid_from_dts >= TIMESTAMP '2024-01-01 00:00:00-05:00'  -- EST
      AND valid_from_dts < TIMESTAMP '2024-02-01 00:00:00-05:00';

    -- Convert to different timezone for display
    SELECT party_key,
           valid_from_dts AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York' AS valid_from_est,
           valid_from_dts AT TIME ZONE 'Europe/London' AS valid_from_gmt
    FROM Party_H;

### 8.6 When TIMESTAMP (without timezone) Is Acceptable

**Use TIMESTAMP without timezone only when:**

- Data is purely local (single timezone, will never expand)
- Regulatory requirement for specific timezone
- Legacy system compatibility required


**Document the timezone assumption explicitly**

---

## 9. Data Quality Management

### 9.1 Advocated Quality Scoring Approach

**Principle**: Agents need to assess data reliability before using it

### 9.2 Quality Score Calculation

**Advocated**: 0.00-1.00 score based on validation rules

    -- Example: Party quality score
    quality_score = (
        CASE WHEN legal_name IS NOT NULL THEN 0.20 ELSE 0 END +
        CASE WHEN tax_identifier IS NOT NULL THEN 0.20 ELSE 0 END +
        CASE WHEN email_address IS NOT NULL AND email_validated = 1 THEN 0.20 ELSE 0 END +
        CASE WHEN phone_number IS NOT NULL AND phone_validated = 1 THEN 0.20 ELSE 0 END +
        CASE WHEN address_complete = 1 THEN 0.20 ELSE 0 END
    )

### 9.3 Two Storage Approaches

#### Approach 1: Store Latest Score in Domain (Extended Column)

    CREATE TABLE Party_H (
        -- ... core columns ...
        data_quality_score DECIMAL(3,2)
            COMMENT 'Quality score 0.00-1.00 based on validation rules',
        -- ...
    );

    -- Agent query
    SELECT party_key, legal_name, data_quality_score
    FROM Party_H
    WHERE is_current = 1
      AND data_quality_score >= 0.75;  -- High quality only

**Pros**: Simple, fast single-table queries **Cons**: Only latest score, no history, adds column overhead

#### Approach 2: Store in Observability (Advocated)

    -- Store quality time-series in Observability
    INSERT INTO Observability.DataQuality_H (
        entity_type, entity_id, evaluated_dts, quality_score,
        rule_results_json
    ) VALUES (
        'PARTY', 1001, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6), 0.80,
        JSON '{"rules": [
            {"rule_id": "R01", "rule_name": "has_legal_name", "passed": true},
            {"rule_id": "R02", "rule_name": "has_tax_id", "passed": true},
            {"rule_id": "R03", "rule_name": "has_email", "passed": true},
            {"rule_id": "R04", "rule_name": "has_phone", "passed": false}
        ]}'
    );

    -- Agent query with quality filter
    SELECT p.party_key, p.legal_name, dq.quality_score
    FROM Party_H p
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT entity_id, quality_score,
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY entity_id ORDER BY evaluated_dts DESC) AS rn
        FROM Observability.DataQuality_H
        WHERE entity_type = 'PARTY'
    ) dq ON dq.entity_id = p.party_id AND dq.rn = 1
    WHERE p.is_current = 1
      AND dq.quality_score >= 0.75;

**Pros**: No Domain overhead, quality history, detailed rule results **Cons**: Requires join (mitigated by views)

### 9.4 Advocated: Use Views for Agent Access

    CREATE VIEW Party_HighQuality AS
    (
    -- View contract: agents see all returned columns without parsing the SELECT body
    party_id,
    party_key,
    legal_name,
    quality_score,
    evaluated_dts,
    rule_results_json
    )
    SELECT p.party_id, p.party_key, p.legal_name,
           dq.quality_score, dq.evaluated_dts,
           dq.rule_results_json
    FROM Party_H p
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT entity_id, quality_score, evaluated_dts, rule_results_json,
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY entity_id ORDER BY evaluated_dts DESC) AS rn
        FROM Observability.DataQuality_H
        WHERE entity_type = 'PARTY'
    ) dq ON dq.entity_id = p.party_id AND dq.rn = 1
    WHERE p.is_current = 1
      AND p.is_deleted = 0
      AND dq.quality_score >= 0.75;

    -- Agent query (simple)
    SELECT * FROM Party_HighQuality WHERE party_key = 'CUST-12345';

### 9.5 Quality Rule Framework

**Advocated**: Standard rule categories

| Rule Category | Examples | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Completeness** | Required fields populated | 30% |
| **Validity** | Format validation, range checks | 25% |
| **Consistency** | Cross-field validation | 20% |
| **Accuracy** | Third-party verification | 15% |
| **Timeliness** | Data freshness | 10% |

---

## 10. Audit Trail Strategy

### 10.1 Why Comprehensive Audit Trails

**Regulatory**: GDPR, CCPA, SOX, HIPAA require audit trails **Explainability**: "Why did the model predict X?" requires historical context **Security**: Detect unauthorized changes **Debugging**: Trace data lineage and transformations

### 10.2 Advocated Audit Approach

**Store detailed audit in Observability.ChangeEvent_H**

    CREATE TABLE Observability.ChangeEvent_H (
        change_event_id    BIGINT NOT NULL,

        changed_dts BETWEEN DATE '2020-01-01' AND DATE '2030-12-31'
        EACH INTERVAL '1' MONTH
    );

### 10.3 Capturing Change Events

    -- Example: Capture UPDATE event
    INSERT INTO Observability.ChangeEvent_H (
        change_event_id, entity_type, entity_id, change_type,
        changed_by, changed_dts, change_reason,
        changed_columns, old_values_json, new_values_json
    )
    SELECT
        change_event_seq.NEXTVAL,
        'PARTY',
        1001,
        'UPDATE',
        'data_steward@company.com',
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6),
        'Customer name change due to marriage',
        JSON '["legal_name"]',
        JSON '{"legal_name": "Jane Doe"}',
        JSON '{"legal_name": "Jane Smith"}';

### 10.4 Audit Trail Queries

    -- Complete audit history for an entity
    SELECT
        changed_dts,
        changed_by,
        change_type,
        change_reason,
        changed_columns,
        old_values_json,
        new_values_json
    FROM Observability.ChangeEvent_H
    WHERE entity_type = 'PARTY'
      AND entity_id = 1001
    ORDER BY changed_dts;

    -- Who deleted this record and why?
    SELECT changed_by, changed_dts, change_reason
    FROM Observability.ChangeEvent_H
    WHERE entity_type = 'PARTY'
      AND entity_id = 1001
      AND change_type = 'DELETE'
    ORDER BY changed_dts DESC
    LIMIT 1;

    -- All changes by a specific user
    SELECT entity_type, entity_id, change_type, changed_dts
    FROM Observability.ChangeEvent_H
    WHERE changed_by = 'data_steward@company.com'
      AND changed_dts >= CURRENT_DATE - 30
    ORDER BY changed_dts DESC;

### 10.5 Retention Policy

**Advocated retention periods:**

| Audit Data Type | Retention | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Recent changes** | 2 years online | Active investigations |
| **Historical changes** | 7 years archived | Regulatory compliance |
| **Deletion records** | 10 years archived | GDPR accountability |
| **High-risk entities** | Indefinite | Fraud, AML compliance |

## 11. Platform Implementation Guidance: Teradata

> **Platform Profile — Teradata** This section is the reference Platform Profile for Teradata implementations of the AI-Native Data Product standard. The structural requirements in the module design standards are platform-agnostic; the guidance below is Teradata-specific. Teams implementing on other platforms should produce an equivalent Platform Profile for their target, covering the same topics: physical key strategy, partitioning, indexing, statistics collection, compression, and query optimisation.

### 11.1 Why Physical Design Matters for AI Workloads

AI-Native workloads have different access patterns than traditional BI:

- Point-in-time feature computation (temporal queries)
- High-volume batch processing (ML training)
- Low-latency single-row lookups (agent queries)
- Cross-module joins (enriched context)


**Advocated approach**: Design physical structures for these specific patterns.

### 11.2 Primary Index Selection

**Primary Index (PI) is the most critical physical design decision in Teradata.**

#### Advocated PI Selection by Entity Type

| Entity Type | Advocated PI | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Core entities** | Surrogate key (UPI) | Even distribution, simple joins |
| **High-volume entities** | Consider natural key (NUPI) | If frequently queried by business ID |
| **Reference data** | Code (UPI) | Code lookups most common |
| **Relationship tables** | Composite FK (NUPI) | Co-locate with parent entity |
| **Time-series entities** | Composite: entity + time (NUPI) | Partition elimination benefits |


#### PI Selection Decision Tree

    START: What is primary access pattern?
    ├─ Single-row lookup by surrogate key?
    │  └─ Use surrogate key UPI ✅
    ├─ Single-row lookup by natural key?
    │  └─ Use natural key UPI ✅
    ├─ Range queries on time + entity?
    │  └─ Use composite (entity_id, time_column) NUPI ✅
    ├─ Frequent joins to parent entity?
    │  └─ Use parent FK for co-location NUPI ✅
    └─ Mixed patterns?
       └─ Use surrogate key UPI + secondary indexes ✅

#### PI Examples

    -- Pattern 1: Surrogate key UPI (most common)
    CREATE TABLE Party_H (
        party_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
        -- ... columns ...
        PRIMARY INDEX (party_id)
    )
    UNIQUE PRIMARY INDEX (party_id, valid_from_dts, transaction_from_dts);

    -- Pattern 2: Natural key UPI (frequent business ID queries)
    CREATE TABLE Product_H (
        product_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
        product_key VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        -- ... columns ...
        PRIMARY INDEX (product_key)  -- If most queries filter on product_key
    )
    UNIQUE PRIMARY INDEX (product_id, valid_from_dts, transaction_from_dts);

    -- Pattern 3: Composite NUPI (relationship table, co-located)
    CREATE TABLE PartyProduct_H (
        party_product_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
        party_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
        product_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
        -- ... columns ...
        PRIMARY INDEX (party_id, product_id)  -- Co-locate with Party
    )
    UNIQUE PRIMARY INDEX (party_product_id, valid_from_dts, transaction_from_dts);

    -- Pattern 4: Time-based composite (time-series data)
    CREATE TABLE Transaction_H (
        transaction_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
        party_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
        transaction_dts TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
        -- ... columns ...
        PRIMARY INDEX (party_id, transaction_dts)  -- Time-series queries
    )
    UNIQUE PRIMARY INDEX (transaction_id, valid_from_dts, transaction_from_dts)
    PARTITION BY RANGE_N(
        transaction_dts BETWEEN DATE '2020-01-01' AND DATE '2030-12-31'
        EACH INTERVAL '1' MONTH
    );

### 11.3 Partitioning Strategy

**Advocate partitioning for:**

- Tables > 100M rows
- Time-series access patterns
- Need for partition elimination


#### Advocated Partitioning Approaches

| Partitioning Dimension | When to Use | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Transaction time** | Most common - queries filter on load/update date | `transaction_from_dts` |
| **Valid time** | Business queries filter on effective date | `valid_from_dts` |
| **Date attribute** | Event data with natural dates | `transaction_date`, `order_date` |
| **Multi-level** | Combine time + status/type | Time + is_deleted |


#### Partitioning Examples

    -- Pattern 1: Monthly partitioning (most common)
    PARTITION BY RANGE_N(
        transaction_from_dts BETWEEN DATE '2020-01-01'
                               AND DATE '2030-12-31'
                               EACH INTERVAL '1' MONTH
    );

    -- Pattern 2: Quarterly partitioning (moderate volume)
    PARTITION BY RANGE_N(
        transaction_from_dts BETWEEN DATE '2020-01-01'
                               AND DATE '2030-12-31'
                               EACH INTERVAL '3' MONTH
    );

    -- Pattern 3: Daily partitioning (very high volume)
    PARTITION BY RANGE_N(
        transaction_dts BETWEEN DATE '2024-01-01'
                          AND DATE '2025-12-31'
                          EACH INTERVAL '1' DAY
    );

    -- Pattern 4: Multi-level (time + status)
    PARTITION BY (
        RANGE_N(
            valid_from_dts BETWEEN DATE '2020-01-01'
                            AND DATE '2030-12-31'
                            EACH INTERVAL '1' YEAR
        ),
        CASE_N(
            is_deleted = 0,   -- Partition 1: Active
            is_deleted = 1,   -- Partition 2: Deleted
            UNKNOWN           -- Partition 3: NULL
        )
    );

#### Partitioning Decision Tree

    START: Table size?
    ├─ < 100M rows → No partitioning needed ⚠️
    └─ > 100M rows → What's primary query pattern?
       ├─ Time range queries common?
       │  └─ Partition by time column ✅
       ├─ Status/type filtering common?
       │  └─ Consider multi-level partitioning ✅
       └─ Full table scans anyway?
          └─ Partitioning won't help ⚠️

### 11.4 Secondary Index Strategy

**Advocate selective use of secondary indexes.**

#### When to Create Secondary Indexes

| Create SI When: | Avoid SI When: |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ Critical query doesn't use PI | ❌ Query is rare/ad-hoc |
| ✅ Query performance unacceptable | ❌ PI already covers query |
| ✅ Insert volume is moderate | ❌ High insert/update volume |
| ✅ Query is frequent | ❌ Query is already fast |


#### Advocated Secondary Index Patterns

    -- Pattern 1: Natural key index (when PI is surrogate key)
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_party_natural_key
    ON Party_H (party_key)
    WHERE is_current = 1 AND is_deleted = 0;

    -- Pattern 2: Foreign key index (for join optimization)
    CREATE INDEX idx_partyproduct_product
    ON PartyProduct_H (product_id)
    WHERE is_current = 1 AND is_deleted = 0;

    -- Pattern 3: Composite index (multi-column filters)
    CREATE INDEX idx_product_category_type
    ON Product_H (product_category, product_type_code)
    WHERE is_current = 1 AND is_deleted = 0;

    -- Pattern 4: Covering index (include frequently selected columns)
    CREATE INDEX idx_party_lookup (party_key, legal_name, status_code)
    ON Party_H (party_key)
    WHERE is_current = 1 AND is_deleted = 0;

### 11.5 Join Index Strategy

**Advocate join indexes for:**

- Expensive joins used frequently
- Pre-computed aggregations
- Materialized views


#### Join Index Patterns

    -- Pattern 1: Current version materialized view
    CREATE JOIN INDEX jidx_party_current AS
    SELECT
        party_id,
        party_key,
        legal_name,
        party_type_code,
        status_code
    FROM Party_H
    WHERE is_current = 1
      AND is_deleted = 0
      AND transaction_to_dts = TIMESTAMP '9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999+00:00'
    PRIMARY INDEX (party_id);

    -- Pattern 2: Denormalized join (frequent join pattern)
    CREATE JOIN INDEX jidx_party_product_denorm AS
    SELECT
        p.party_id,
        p.party_key,
        p.legal_name,
        pp.product_id,
        pr.product_key,
        pr.product_name
    FROM Party_H p
    INNER JOIN PartyProduct_H pp
        ON p.party_id = pp.party_id
    INNER JOIN Product_H pr
        ON pp.product_id = pr.product_id
    WHERE p.is_current = 1 AND p.is_deleted = 0
      AND pp.is_current = 1 AND pp.is_deleted = 0
      AND pr.is_current = 1 AND pr.is_deleted = 0
    PRIMARY INDEX (party_id);

    -- Pattern 3: Pre-computed aggregation
    CREATE JOIN INDEX jidx_party_metrics AS
    SELECT
        party_id,
        COUNT(*) AS product_cnt,
        SUM(balance_amt) AS total_balance_amt,
        MAX(last_transaction_dts) AS last_activity_dts
    FROM Party_H p
    INNER JOIN PartyProduct_H pp ON p.party_id = pp.party_id
    WHERE p.is_current = 1 AND p.is_deleted = 0
      AND pp.is_current = 1 AND pp.is_deleted = 0
    GROUP BY party_id
    PRIMARY INDEX (party_id);

### 11.6 Compression Strategy

**Advocate compression for large text columns.**

#### Compression Candidates

| Column Type | Compress? | Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Large text (>500 chars)** | ✅ Yes | AUTO COMPRESS |
| **JSON columns** | ✅ Yes | AUTO COMPRESS or ZLIB |
| **Sparse columns** | ✅ Yes | AUTO COMPRESS |
| **Small strings (<50 chars)** | ❌ No | Overhead exceeds benefit |
| **Numeric columns** | ❌ No | Minimal benefit |
| **Frequently updated** | ⚠️ Caution | Recompression cost |


#### Compression Examples

    -- Pattern 1: AUTO COMPRESS (recommended)
    CREATE TABLE Party_H (
        party_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
        -- ... other columns ...
        notes_txt VARCHAR(5000),
        address_text VARCHAR(500)
    )
    WITH COLUMN_PARTITION = (
        AUTO COMPRESS (notes_txt, address_text)
    );

    -- Pattern 2: Specific algorithm for very large text
    CREATE TABLE Document_H (
        document_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
        document_content CLOB
    )
    WITH COLUMN_PARTITION = (
        COLUMN (document_content) COMPRESS USING ZLIBHIGH
    );

### 11.7 Statistics Collection

**Advocate automated statistics collection.**

#### Statistics Strategy

    -- Collect stats on critical columns
    COLLECT STATISTICS
    COLUMN (party_id),
    COLUMN (party_key),
    COLUMN (party_type_code),
    COLUMN (is_current),
    COLUMN (is_deleted),
    COLUMN (valid_from_dts),
    COLUMN (transaction_from_dts)
    ON Party_H;

    -- Collect stats on composite filters
    COLLECT STATISTICS
    COLUMN (party_type_code, is_current, is_deleted)
    ON Party_H;

    -- For large tables, use sampling
    COLLECT STATISTICS ON Party_H USING SAMPLE 10 PERCENT;

#### Advocated Collection Schedule

| Table Size | Frequency | Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **< 1M rows** | After major loads | Full scan |
| **1M - 100M rows** | Daily | 10% sample |
| **> 100M rows** | Weekly | 5% sample |
| **Reference tables** | After changes only | Full scan |

## Document Change Log

| Version | Date | Changes | Author |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.6 | 2026-05-08 | Added Section 6 (Access Layer). Defers placement, naming, separation, and access to the Object Placement Standard (interface specification + platform implementations). Establishes the principle of reading through views without prescribing where tables and views are placed. Lists builder/agent behaviour: locate a conforming Object Placement Standard before generating any object; halt and ask if absent. Sections 6–11 renumbered to 7–12. Subsection numbers within the renumbered Implementation Decision Trees corrected from 11.1–11.4 to 12.1–12.4. | Paul Dancer, Worldwide Field Tech, Teradata |
| 1.5 | 2026-04-15 | Established platform neutrality. Renamed Section 10 from "Physical Design for Teradata" to "Platform Implementation Guidance: Teradata" and added a Platform Profile preamble making explicit that this section is Teradata-specific and that other platforms should produce equivalent profiles. Section 10 content unchanged. | Nathan Green, Worldwide Data Architecture Team, Teradata |
| 1.4 | 2026-04-10 | Section 4 (Surrogate Key Strategy) rewritten to address surrogate key instability in SCD Type 2 tables (issue #7). Added Section 4.2 explaining why IDENTITY on _H tables fails; Section 4.3 documenting the recommended Keymap pattern (with flexibility note that organisations should use their own standard if one exists); Section 4.4 (Reference and Lookup Table Exemption) clarifying that reference/lookup tables and detail entities not FK-referenced may use IDENTITY directly; Section 4.5 providing a decision tree with three allocation options; Section 4.6 (natural keys, renamed from old 4.4). Removed old Sections 4.2-4.3 which incorrectly advocated IDENTITY on _H tables. | Nathan Green, Worldwide Data Architecture Team, Teradata |
| 1.3 | 2026-03-20 | Completed swap of id and key to be consistent throughout design standards | Nathan Green, Worldwide Data Architecture Team, Teradata |
| 1.2 | 2026-03-18 | Renamed is_current_version → is_current throughout, aligned with Domain Module Design Standard naming convention | Kimiko Yabu, Worldwide Data Architecture Team, Teradata |
| 1.1 | 2026-03-17 | Updated naming convention throughout: {entity}_id = Surrogate Key (BIGINT), {entity}_key = Natural Business Key (VARCHAR), aligned with Domain Module Design Standard v2.1 | Kimiko Yabu, Worldwide Data Architecture Team, Teradata |
| 1.0 | 2025-02-09 | Initial Advocated Data Management Standards | Data Architecture |
