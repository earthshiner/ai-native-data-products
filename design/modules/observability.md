# Observability Module: Design Standard

## AI-Native Data Product Architecture

---

## Document Control

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Status** | STANDARD |
| **Type** | Module Design Standard (platform-agnostic) |
| **Scope** | Observability module: monitoring, feedback, lineage, and the home of validation results |
| **Extends** | [Master Design](../core/MASTER_DESIGN.md) |
| **Notation** | [Design Language](../core/DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md) |
| **Implementations** | [`implementation/teradata/modules/observability/`](../../implementation/teradata/modules/observability/) |

Observability is the operational-evidence module: it monitors product health, records lineage, and is the **home of validation results** ([validation pattern](../patterns/validation.md)). It closes the feedback loop by supplying the learning inputs Memory consumes.

---

## 1. Purpose

Observability monitors data-product health and enables continuous improvement through outcome tracking and feedback loops. Its capabilities: data-quality monitoring, change tracking (audit trail), data lineage (definitional and operational), performance monitoring, outcome tracking, hosting validation evidence, and — optionally — exposing its lineage and access history as a traversable graph (§5.1).

**Events and metrics, not data** (`INV-OBS-001`). Observability records *that* something happened and *how it measured*, never the business data itself. "Party_H was updated by ETL at 02:15, 250,000 records affected, quality 0.95", never the customer records.

---

## 2. Scope and Boundaries

**In scope:** change events (what/when/who/why, table-level), data-quality metrics, data lineage (declared flows and their executions), performance metrics, outcome tracking, validation results, and an optional graph-native lineage exposure (§5.1) for products that need graph traversal rather than only tabular discovery.

**Out of scope:** business domain data (→ Domain); query result sets (not stored). Event-scale volume is acceptable (millions of events); business content is not. The graph-explorer platform itself (the shared engine, quality procedures, and rendering layer are external, normative dependencies this module conforms to, not defines) and cross-product federated lineage (a separate, explicitly designed federated graph, not a retrofit onto a per-product graph) are also out of scope.

---

## 3. Lineage Separation Principle

Lineage is modelled as two distinct concerns (`INV-OBS-003`):

| Concern | Entity | Question | Cardinality |
|---------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Definitional** | `DataLineage` | *What are the declared data flows?* | One row per source → job → target |
| **Operational** | `LineageRun` | *Did this flow run, and how did it go?* | Many rows per flow over time |

Separating them yields a stable, deduplicated edge list for graph visualisation, and keeps execution monitoring on the events-and-metrics principle. It also allows **independent retention**: definitions live as long as the product, while runs follow event-retention windows (`INV-OBS-004`). Mutation semantics stay clear, since a new `DataLineage` row is a new flow and a new `LineageRun` row is a new execution of an existing flow.

---

## 4. Entity Model

All entities are append-oriented operational records (`EVENT_APPEND_ONLY`, except `DataLineage` which carries an `is_active` lifecycle). All apply `object-placement`, `access-layer`; all require `RichMetadata`. Table references are table-level; content is obtained by join-back to Domain.

```

**Validation results.** The [validation pattern](../patterns/validation.md)'s result record, the `ValidationRun` entity, is homed in this module as append-only evidence (`EVENT_APPEND_ONLY`, `INV-OBS-005`). Its contract is owned by the validation pattern; this module provides its container. The entity name is fixed by that contract: conformance queries resolve it by name and report clean against anything else.

### 4.1 Graph Node and Edge Model (optional, `graph-lineage` facet)

A product that enables the `graph-lineage` facet (§8.1) maps `DataLineage` and `AgentOutcome` into a graph-explorer-conformant node/edge adapter, so lineage can be opened in Teradata Graph Explorer, traced, and rendered as a graph, rather than only queried as the tabular `lineage_graph` edge list (§5). This is a mapping onto the entities already defined in §4, not a new system of record (`INV-OBS-007`).

**Node categories:**

| `category` | `node_role` values | Natural key | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `table` | `source_table`, `target_table` | `container_name.object_name` | `DataLineage.source_table`/`target_table` |
| `column` | `source_column`, `target_column` | `container_name.object_name.column_name` | `DataLineage.source_column`/`target_column`, only where the `column-lineage` facet (§8.1) is also enabled |
| `job` | `etl_job` | `job_name` | `DataLineage.job_name` (first-class node, as `lineage_graph` already treats it) |
| `agent` | `consumer` | `agent_key` | `AgentOutcome.agent_key` |
| `query_session` | `session` | `session_key` | `AgentOutcome.session_key` (omit this category entirely if a product does not need session-grain traversal) |

`node` is the dense surrogate identity assigned at load time (§5.1); the natural key above is carried as a separate, non-canonical attribute per the graph-explorer contract's rule that a natural key must not replace `node`.

**Edge types**, registered in the graph catalogue's `graph_relationship` vocabulary, all `ASYMMETRIC`:

| `edge_type` | Direction (`node_i` → `node_j`) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `produces` | upstream (source table or job) → downstream (job or target table) | `DataLineage`, one edge per source→job leg and job→target leg |
| `derives_column` | source column → target column | `DataLineage.source_column`/`target_column`, only where `column-lineage` is enabled |
| `accessed_by` | table → agent | `AgentOutcome.tables_accessed` (exploded to one row per accessed table) |
| `queried_in` | agent → query_session | `AgentOutcome.session_key` |

`is_weighted=0`; every edge emits `weight=1.0` per the contract's guidance for unweighted graphs. `has_relationship=1` since `edge_type` is always populated and vocabulary-backed.

---

## 5. Discovery Exposure

Two views are deployed **into the Semantic container** so agents discover lineage from the same place they discover everything else (Semantic):

- **`lineage_graph`**: a graph-ready edge list built from `DataLineage`, with jobs surfaced as first-class nodes (source → job, job → target). Its definition **filters to active lineage definitions**, and does so in the view body rather than leaving it to the caller: no duplicate edges from repeated executions, so the graph is stable and deduplicated (`INV-OBS-006`). Omitting the filter is not a cosmetic lapse. Retired flows stay in the graph and there is nothing in the result to mark them as retired, so an agent navigating lineage is led to a flow that no longer runs and cannot tell.
- **`lineage_run_latest`**: each active flow joined to its most recent execution, for dashboards showing last-run status against the blueprint.

### 5.1 Graph-Native Exposure (optional, `graph-lineage` facet)

Where `lineage_graph` is the lightweight discovery edge-list for agents already inside Semantic, a product that enables the `graph-lineage` facet additionally binds its lineage and access records to the external **Teradata Graph Explorer** data contract (out-of-repo, normative for consumer adapters — `graph-data-contract.md` in the `teradata-graph-explorer` repository): a heavier, separately-packaged adapter for graph-native tooling, built from the same source-of-truth entities (§4), so an agent or analyst can open the product's lineage in Graph Explorer, search it, trace it upstream/downstream, and visualise it rather than only query it as a tabular edge list. Nothing here creates a second system of record: it reads `DataLineage`/`AgentOutcome` only and never writes back into them (`INV-OBS-007`).

**Graph scope principle.** One data product, one graph (`DEC-GRAPH-SCOPE`, §11.1, decided, not left open per product): each data product registers its own `graph_key` (e.g. `lineage_<product>`), its own `Graphs_<KEY>_STD_0_T`/`ACL_0_V` objects, and its own catalogue row (`INV-OBS-008`). `community` is not used to represent product ownership — the contract defines `community` as an instance grouping or analytical partition that may change between graph builds (e.g. Louvain clustering); product identity is a stable governance fact that must never move between runs, and conflating the two would also block a product from using `community` for its own legitimate subject-area clustering. Cross-product federated lineage, if ever needed, is a separate, explicitly designed federated graph with `data_product` as a genuine `category` value on its own nodes — out of scope for this module.

**Load semantics.** A set-based upsert from `DataLineage`/`AgentOutcome` into the graph tables, run on the same cadence as lineage/outcome capture or on a scheduled interval (`DEC-GRAPH-LOAD-CADENCE`, §11.1):

1. **Node upsert**: natural keys (§4.1) are resolved against the existing node table; an unseen natural key receives a newly allocated `node_id`, dense and never reused. Existing natural keys are not renumbered — a node identity refers to the same logical entity for the life of a published graph version (`INV-OBS-009`).
2. **Edge upsert**: `DataLineage` and `AgentOutcome` rows resolve their natural keys to `node_id` and are inserted as `(node_i, node_j, edge_type, weight)`, deduplicated on `(node_i, node_j, edge_type)`.
3. Only `DataLineage` rows with `is_active=1` are loaded, matching `INV-OBS-006`'s stability guarantee: a retired flow does not appear as a live edge in the graph.

**Graph Product contract binding**, for graph key `<KEY>` (one per data product):

| Plane | Object | Populated by |
|---|---|---|
| Data tables | `Graphs_<KEY>_STD_0_T.graph_nodes`, `.graph_edges` | Load path above |
| Data locking views | `Graphs_<KEY>_STD_0_V.*` | Standard locking wrapper |
| Consumer adapters | `Graphs_<KEY>_ACL_0_V.graph_nodes`, `.graph_edges`, `.graph_edges_bi` | Canonical column remap — the only surface external consumers bind to |
| Read role | `R_Graphs_<KEY>_READ` | Standard grant |
| Catalogue | `Graphs_CAT_STD_0_T.graph_registry`, `.graph_relationship`, `.graph_role`, `.graph_trace_profile` | One-time registration, updated only on vocabulary change |

This exposure's SHIPS package declares the shared `graph-platform` package as an `EXTERNAL_PARENT`; it does not recreate it.

**Trace profiles**, registered in `graph_trace_profile`:

| `profile_id` | `direction` | `relationship` | `stop_at_roles` | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `trace_to_source` | `upstream` | `produces`(`,derives_column` if `column-lineage` enabled) | — | Where did this table/column come from? |
| `impact_analysis` | `downstream` | `produces`(`,derives_column` if `column-lineage` enabled) | — | What breaks if this table/column changes? |
| `who_touched_this` | `downstream` | `accessed_by,queried_in` | `session` | Which agents/sessions have consumed this data? |

---

## 6. Open Standards Alignment

The lineage entities align with **OpenLineage**: the definition/execution split mirrors OpenLineage's separation of a `Job` (declared flow → `DataLineage`) from a `Run` (execution → `LineageRun`). `source`/`target` container+table compose into OpenLineage dataset names; `openlineage_namespace` and `openlineage_job_name`/`openlineage_run_id` carry the OpenLineage identifiers. Data-quality metric names align with common frameworks (Great Expectations, Deequ). The concrete event construction is an implementation concern.

---

## 7. Applied Patterns

| Pattern | Contribution to Observability |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| `temporal-lifecycle-metadata` | Event entities declare the `EVENT_APPEND_ONLY` profile; `DataLineage` carries an `is_active` lifecycle. When `graph-lineage` is enabled, its node/edge tables carry `created_dts` as provenance only, never business validity. |
| `object-placement` | Which container the tables and views live in, and who may reach them; governs the `Graphs_<KEY>_*` container naming and locking-view pairing when `graph-lineage` is enabled. |
| `access-layer` | `ROLE_AGENT` write-back (append) to this module: agents record outcomes and quality signals (Phase 2.5). `R_Graphs_<KEY>_READ` is the sole consumer-facing grant onto the graph exposure when enabled. |
| `validation` | Hosts the validation results and the trust map; its own quality/lineage evidence is a validator source. The external graph-explorer contract's own structural and semantic quality gates are the validator source for the `graph-lineage` facet. |

---

## 8. Capabilities and Composition

Observability is **cross-cutting and soft**: nothing hard-depends on it, and it hard-depends on nothing, so it observes whatever modules are present. It appears in a traditional data product and an AI-native product, and is absent from a minimal Data Asset.

### 8.1 Facets

Beyond its always-present base, Observability exposes two facets that a product enables independently (see the [composition mechanism](../core/DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md)); `column-lineage` only adds anything once `graph-lineage` is also enabled:

| Facet | Holds | Provides |
|---|---|---|
| **`graph-lineage`** | The graph-explorer node/edge adapter (§4.1, §5.1): `Graphs_<KEY>_*` tables, catalogue registration, trace profiles. | `GraphNativeLineageTraversal`. |
| **`column-lineage`** | Populated `DataLineage.source_column`/`.target_column`; `column` nodes and `derives_column` edges within the `graph-lineage` adapter. | `ColumnGrainLineageTraversal`, catalogue-registered so a consumer can discover it without querying the graph. |

A product that does not enable `graph-lineage` gets the tabular `lineage_graph` discovery view (§5) only. A product that enables `graph-lineage` but not `column-lineage` gets the full graph adapter at table grain: it does not populate the column extension, and its catalogue registration omits the `derives_column` relationship and `COLUMN` role, so an agent can tell the capability is absent from the catalogue alone rather than by tracing an empty result.

**Provides:**

| Capability | Facet | Made available to |
|------------|-------|-------------------|
| `ChangeEventCapture` | — | Any module recording who changed an entity instance, when, and why: the audit trail that `DEC-COLUMN-STRATEGY` offloads here. |
| `LineageCapture` | — | Any module recording the origin of an instance: source system, source record, and producing run. |
| `AgentOutcomeCapture` | — | Any module or exposure layer recording which tables an agent touched, when, and with what outcome (`AgentOutcome`). |
| `QualityScore` | — | Agents judging fitness before use, and Memory as a learning input. Held as a time series per `DEC-QUALITY-STORAGE`. |
| Validation results home | — | The validation pattern, as the container for `validation_run` and the `validation_area` trust map. |
| Lineage exposure (definitional + operational) | — | Agents and dashboards, via the Semantic exposure. |
| `GraphNativeLineageTraversal` | `graph-lineage` | Teradata Graph Explorer and any agent/analyst using it: upstream/downstream trace, impact analysis, and access-path traversal over this product's lineage. |
| `ColumnGrainLineageTraversal` | `column-lineage` | Teradata Graph Explorer and any agent/analyst using it: column-to-column derivation trace, in addition to table-grain trace. |

**Requires:**

| Capability | Strength | Provider | Why |
|------------|----------|----------|-----|
| `RichMetadata` | `[hard]` | `self` / `platform` | Agent-readable metadata on every object. |
| `SemanticRegistration` | `[soft]` | `module:Semantic` | Register its entities and deploy the lineage views into the Semantic container. |
| `DocumentationCapture` | `[soft]` | `module:Memory` | Record its own design decisions. |
| `EntityJoinBack` | `[soft]` | `module:Domain` | Resolve a table reference to Domain context when needed. |
| Graph platform runtime | `[hard]`, only when `graph-lineage` is enabled | `external:graph-platform` | Catalogue, engine, and quality procedures the `graph-lineage` facet's package does not itself define. |

---

## 9. Integration with Other Modules

- **Observability → Memory**: outcomes and quality trends feed Memory's learned strategies (the closed loop). Memory soft-requires these learning inputs.
- **Observability + Domain**: table-level change tracking of Domain loads; one event per batch, never per record.
- **Observability monitors all modules**: quality, performance, and lineage across whatever is deployed.
- **Observability + external `graph-platform`**: when `graph-lineage` is enabled, hard-depends on the shared catalogue, engine, and quality procedures (§8); provides no capability the platform itself does not already define, only this product's specific graph. No integration with Semantic: `lineage_graph` (§5) stays the Semantic-facing discovery edge-list; the graph adapter is a separate, heavier surface for graph-native tooling and does not register into the Semantic map.

---

## 10. Invariants

- `INV-OBS-001`: Observability stores events and metrics, never business data or query result sets.
- `INV-OBS-002`: change tracking is table-level with aggregate metrics (e.g. `records_affected`), never individual record keys, and **never** before/after business values: capturing changed column *values* (e.g. old/new `legal_name`, `email`) duplicates Domain content into Observability and is a PII / data-privacy defect. The audit trail records *what table changed, when, by whom, and how many rows*: not the data itself; the prior state is reconstructed from Domain's temporal history.
- `INV-OBS-003`: lineage is split: `DataLineage` declares flows (one row per source → job → target), `LineageRun` records executions (one row per run).
- `INV-OBS-004`: definitional lineage is retained for the life of the product; execution records follow independent event-retention windows.
- `INV-OBS-005`: validation results are homed here as append-only evidence (`EVENT_APPEND_ONLY`), both the run record and the per-area trust map.
- `INV-OBS-006`: the lineage graph/edge-list consumed by discovery reads active definitions only, so it is stable and deduplicated.
- `INV-OBS-007`: when `graph-lineage` is enabled, its node/edge tables are a read-derived exposure of `DataLineage`/`AgentOutcome`; they carry table/column/job/agent identifiers only, never business row data, and are never written back into by anything else.
- `INV-OBS-008`: one data product registers exactly one lineage graph (`DEC-GRAPH-SCOPE`, §5.1); `community` is never used to encode product ownership.
- `INV-OBS-009`: a graph node's surrogate `node_id`, once allocated, refers to the same logical entity for the life of the published graph version; natural-key resolution never reuses or shifts an existing `node_id` value.

---

## 11. Designer Responsibilities

**Designers supply:** the quality metrics and thresholds; the declared lineage flows; the OpenLineage scope; retention policies (separately for `DataLineage` vs `LineageRun`); which modules are monitored; whether the `graph-lineage` facet is enabled and, if so, the graph key, whether `query_session` nodes are needed, the load cadence, and whether `column-lineage` is also enabled.

**Design review checklist:**

- [ ] Every attribute uses a logical type; no platform types leak into this document.
- [ ] Events/metrics only; no business data or result sets (`INV-OBS-001`).
- [ ] Change tracking is table-level with aggregate metrics (`INV-OBS-002`).
- [ ] Lineage flows registered in `DataLineage`; executions logged in `LineageRun` (`INV-OBS-003`).
- [ ] Separate retention policies for definition vs execution (`INV-OBS-004`).
- [ ] Validation results homed here (`INV-OBS-005`); `lineage_graph` / `lineage_run_latest` deployed to Semantic.
- [ ] Entities registered in the Semantic map (`SemanticRegistration`); documentation captured, including the lineage split as a design decision.
- [ ] If `graph-lineage` is enabled: graph key chosen and unique across the estate (`INV-OBS-008`); catalogue rows registered before the ACL views are published; `R_Graphs_<KEY>_READ` is the only grant issued.
- [ ] `column-lineage` enabled only if column-level lineage is in scope for this product; the `DataLineage` column extension populated and catalogue rows registered together, never one without the other.
- [ ] This document passes the design linter with no ignore directive.

---

### 11.1 Decisions to settle

These are the catalogued decisions a Observability module design must settle. The recommendation is this standard's default; the question is what shifts it. The design skill walks a designer through each one at design time and records the answer in the product's own design.


| Decision | Recommended | Settle it by asking |
|---|---|---|
| `DEC-QUALITY-STORAGE` | `observability` | Does anything examine quality trend or per-rule detail, or only the latest score? |
| `DEC-AUDIT-RETENTION` | `regulatory` | Which entities carry a retention obligation, and how long does it run? |
| `DEC-TIMESTAMP-ZONE` | `zone-aware` | Are events recorded across regions? |
| `DEC-GRAPH-SCOPE` | one graph per data product | Already settled by this standard (§5.1); revisit only when a genuine cross-product federated graph is separately designed. |
| `DEC-GRAPH-COLUMN-LINEAGE` | omit the `column-lineage` facet unless requested | Does any consumer need column-grain trace, or is table-grain sufficient? |
| `DEC-GRAPH-SESSION-NODES` | omit unless requested | Is session-level access traversal (`query_session` nodes) actually queried, or does `agent`-level suffice? |
| `DEC-GRAPH-LOAD-CADENCE` | same cadence as lineage capture | Does graph-explorer need near-real-time lineage, or is a scheduled batch load sufficient? |

---

## 12. Implementation

The Teradata binding (the event, metric, and lineage tables, the `lineage_graph` and `lineage_run_latest` Semantic views, the OpenLineage event construction, and — when `graph-lineage` is enabled — the graph-explorer adapter tables, catalogue seed, and load path) lives in [`implementation/teradata/modules/observability/`](../../implementation/teradata/modules/observability/). The validation results table is defined by the [validation pattern implementation](../../implementation/teradata/patterns/validation/) and deployed into this module's container. The external graph-explorer contract itself — ACL column shapes, catalogue table definitions, and quality procedures — is defined in the `teradata-graph-explorer` repository's `docs/graph-data-contract.md` and is out of scope for this repository to redefine.

**End of Observability Module Design Standard**
