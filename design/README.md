# Design

Platform-neutral design hierarchy: **what** an AI-Native Data Product is and **why**, independent of any target platform. Its counterpart is [`implementation/`](../implementation), which holds the **how** for each platform.

Everything here is written in the notation defined by [`core/DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md`](core/DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md), and the [design linter](../tooling/validation) enforces it: a design document that leaks platform SQL fails the build.

---

## Structure

```
design/
├── core/       the notation, the vocabulary, the architecture, the decisions
├── modules/    one document per module, logical rules only
└── patterns/   the logical/physical bridge, each with a platform binding
```

**`core/`** describes the architecture as a whole rather than any one module or pattern: the notation everything is written in, the shared vocabulary, the master design, and the decision catalogue.

**`modules/`** holds one document per module, carrying logical rules, entities, responsibilities, relationships, with no physical representation.

**`patterns/`** is the bridge layer between logical design and physical implementation. The membership test is: **does this document have, or need, a per-platform binding document?** If yes, it is a pattern, regardless of which module references it. The validation pattern names Observability as its module home but lives here, because the binding pairing is the structural signal and module ownership is a content-level cross-reference.

## The platform-neutrality test

Nothing under `design/` may contain a SQL keyword, a vendor data type, a catalogue query, indexing syntax, or deployment-tool behaviour. That is the enforceable test for whether a document belongs here or under `implementation/{platform}/`.

---

## Anchor mapping

`design/` and `implementation/{platform}/` share **anchor names**: the basename of a module or pattern. Given an anchor, either path is computable without a lookup table:

| Design | Teradata implementation |
|--------|-------------------------|
| `design/modules/{anchor}.md` | `implementation/teradata/modules/{anchor}/` |
| `design/patterns/{anchor}.md` | `implementation/teradata/patterns/{anchor}/` |

The implementation side is a **directory** per anchor rather than a single file, because one binding is often more than one artifact: a design document plus one or more templates. See [`implementation/teradata/README.md`](../implementation/teradata/README.md) for what those directories contain.

`design/core/` has no implementation counterpart: it is architecture-level material with nothing to bind.

---

## Normative versus advisory

Not everything under `design/` carries the same weight:

- **Normative**: required for conformance. A product that violates a normative rule is not conformant.
- **Advisory**: recommended practice. Useful, but not a conformance requirement.

Every document declares its own classification in frontmatter, as `normative: true` or `normative: false`; the catalogue above marks advisory documents explicitly. Directory placement is a navigation aid, not a substitute for that declaration: read the frontmatter before treating a rule as binding.

**Advocated practice is not a third category.** Recommendations that were once advisory prose are expressed as **decisions** (see the [Design Language](core/DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md)): each names its options, marks one advocated, and states when the others are sound. What is normative is that an applicable decision must be *declared*; which option a product picks is its own. This is why there is no `guidance/` directory: advisory material that sits outside the design workflow cannot be applied consistently or checked at all, which is the problem the decision construct solves.

---

## Document identity

Each document opens with a short frontmatter block declaring `title`, `anchor`, `type`, `status` (`draft` / `standard` / `deprecated`), `version`, and `normative`: identity only.

Everything else lives in the body: what a document provides and requires, and the decisions it asks a designer to settle. Frontmatter is an index card, not an abstract: a capability graph stated in both a header and a body table is two things to maintain and two things to disagree. The catalogue above reads the body tables, so the graph is machine-readable in one place without any document restating it.

## Relationship to extensions and profiles

Issues #10 and #16 define a governance model of core standards, additive extensions, and composable profiles. That model maps onto this structure as follows:

- **Core standards** → `design/core/`, `design/modules/`, `design/patterns/`.
- **Platform extensions** → `implementation/{platform}/`. Extensions are additive: they may specialise a design document, but must not redefine its semantics or weaken its invariants.
- **Non-platform extensions** (deployment, interoperability, security, domain overlays) have no home in this scaffold yet. They are not platform bindings, so `implementation/` is the wrong place for them.
- **Profiles**, approved combinations of a core set plus selected extensions, likewise have no home yet.

Reconciling this hierarchy with the extension and profile taxonomy of #16 is open work, tracked against #44 rather than settled here.

## Empty directories

A directory reserved before it has content is held in git by an empty `.gitkeep` file. It marks the location and nothing more: no document is there, and the absence of one carries no meaning. Nothing should read, render, or compile a `.gitkeep`.
