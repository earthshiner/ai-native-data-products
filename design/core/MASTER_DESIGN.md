# AI-Native Data Product: Master Design Standard

## AI-Native Data Product Architecture: Core Framework

---

## Document Control

| Attribute | Value |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Status** | STANDARD |
| **Type** | Core (Architectural Blueprint) |
| **Scope** | The whole framework: the modules, how they compose, and the principles, capabilities, and contracts every composition follows |
| **Notation** | [Design Language](DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md) · [Glossary](GLOSSARY.md) |
| **Extended by** | The module design standards under [`design/modules/`](../modules/) and the patterns under [`design/patterns/`](../patterns/) |

---

## 1. Purpose

This is the architectural blueprint for a **modular library of data design patterns**. The library is a set of independent, composable modules; assembling a chosen subset produces a particular kind of data asset: a minimal governed data asset, a traditional data product, a full AI-native data product, or an extension bolted onto something that already exists. There is no single fixed architecture: an **AI-Native Data Product is the fullest composition**, not the only one.

The standards are **platform-agnostic**. Everything here holds on every deployment platform; each platform's concrete binding lives under [`implementation/`](../../implementation/) (see Design Standards and Platform Implementation). Module design standards extend this document with per-module detail; a specific data product (a Customer 360, a fraud-detection product) *applies* a composition with concrete entity names.

| This document defines (reusable) | A specific product supplies (varies) |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| The module library and how it composes | Which composition it uses |
| Integration and discovery patterns | Its actual entity names |
| Capabilities modules provide and require | Its database names |
| Principles and framework invariants | Its business-specific attributes |

---

## 2. Vision and Guiding Principles

**Vision.** Move from human-mediated data access to agent-native data platforms: products an agent can navigate without human narration.

**Guiding principles:**

1. **Modularity first**: each module is independently deployable and composes freely with others.
2. **Progressive enhancement**: start from a traditional data model; add capabilities incrementally by adding modules.
3. **Zero data duplication**: reference source data and join back to it; never copy it. Bound by `INV-MASTER-001`.
4. **Self-describing**: a product exposes its own semantics, contracts, and relationships as queryable metadata, not just prose.
5. **Agent-native design**: optimise for machine interpretation, not only human readability.
6. **Standards-driven**: consult design-time knowledge stores (naming, industry models) for consistency and compliance.
7. **Platform-neutral by construction**: structural standards are platform-agnostic; all platform specifics live in `implementation/{platform}/`. Enforced by the [design/implementation split](DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md) and the linter, not left as a principle to remember.

```

| Module | Purpose | Design standard |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain** | Authoritative source of truth for business entities, relationships, reference data, and history. The composition root every other module builds on. | [domain.md](../modules/domain.md) |
| **Search** | Semantic retrieval: vector embeddings and similarity search over Domain entities and content. | [search.md](../modules/search.md) |
| **Prediction** | Feature store: engineered features and model inputs/outputs derived from Domain, with point-in-time consistency. | [prediction.md](../modules/prediction.md) |
| **Observability** | Data-product operational data: quality metrics, agent interactions, outcomes, and events. | [observability.md](../modules/observability.md) |
| **Semantic** | Knowledge and meaning: the queryable map of entities, columns, relationships, naming, and rules that lets agents discover and reason. | [semantic.md](../modules/semantic.md) |
| **Memory** | Two facets: the **documentation** store (design decisions, glossary, change history) and the **runtime** store (agent state and learning). Facets are enabled independently. | [memory.md](../modules/memory.md) |

---

## 4. Compositions

A **composition** assembles a subset of the module library into a data design pattern. The [Design Language](DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md) defines the mechanism: how modules declare what they **Provide** and **Require** (`[hard]`/`[soft]`, `self`/`module`/`platform`), and the rule that a composition is valid when every `[hard]` requirement is met within it.

**Dependency structure.** Domain is the root. Search and Prediction **hard-depend** on Domain (they reference Domain entities and join back for content). Semantic, Observability, and Memory are cross-cutting and **soft**: they describe, observe, or document whatever modules are present. So the missing or disabled capabilities in any composition follow directly from which modules it includes.

**Standard compositions** (illustrative presets: free composition is allowed whenever hard dependencies are met):

| Composition | Modules (+ facets) | Disabled / absent |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Asset** | Domain + Memory[`documentation`] + Access Layer | No discovery map (agents fall back to catalogue + `RichMetadata`); no similarity, features, or monitoring. |
| **Traditional Data Product** | Domain + Semantic + Observability (+ optional Memory[`documentation`]) + Access Layer | No vectors, no features, no agent runtime state. |
| **AI-Native Data Product** | Domain + Semantic + Search + Prediction + Observability + Memory[`documentation`+`runtime`] + Access Layer | Nothing: the maximal composition. |
| **Search extension** | Search added onto an existing Domain | Valid because Domain (the hard dependency) is already present. |

Where a pattern wants documentation but deploys no Memory module, its documentation lives in an external store: that is outside the scope of these standards (`DocumentationCapture` is then simply absent, and modules that soft-require it skip capture). Enabling or disabling a capability is never a code change to a module: it follows from the composition.

---

## 5. Framework Capabilities

Every module provides and requires capabilities from the [capability catalogue](DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md), bound per platform in `implementation/`. The guiding principles are realised as these capabilities:

| Principle | Realised as capability | Availability |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Zero data duplication | `EntityJoinBack`: a module holds an `Identifier` and joins back to Domain for content. | Whenever Domain is present. |
| Temporal integrity | `CurrentStateFilter`, `PointInTimeReconstruction`. | Intrinsic to entity-bearing modules. |
| Self-describing | `RichMetadata`: agent-readable metadata on every object and attribute. | Always. |
| Self-describing (discovery) | `SemanticRegistration`: modules register in the Semantic map. | Only when Semantic is in the composition (soft). |
| Self-describing (provenance) | `DocumentationCapture`: modules record decisions, glossary, and change history. | Only when Memory's `documentation` facet is present (soft). |
| Agent-native access | The **Access Layer** roles that make a deployed composition reachable (see Access Layer). | When deployed for consumption. |

A module names the capabilities it provides and requires; the platform implementation binds each one. No capability assumes a platform mechanism, and cross-module capabilities are conditional on the composition (see Compositions).

---

## 6. Cross-Module Integration Patterns

1. **Join-back**: every module references Domain entities by `Identifier` and joins back for content. Single source of truth, no duplication (`EntityJoinBack`, `INV-MASTER-001`).
2. **Enhancement**: modules progressively enhance Domain. Search adds embeddings, Prediction adds features, Semantic adds relationship metadata, and each can deploy incrementally.
3. **Feedback loop**. Observability → Memory → Prediction: outcomes captured by Observability inform Memory and, in turn, future features and predictions. Present only when those modules are.

---

## 7. Agent Discovery

When a composition includes the Semantic module, it is the **map** an agent uses to navigate with no human guidance, through a three-tier discovery hierarchy:

1. **Module discovery**: which modules are deployed and where.
2. **Entity discovery**: which entities exist in each module, and their keys and structure.
3. **Relationship discovery**: how entities relate, including multi-hop join paths.

**Bootstrap convention.** An agent is given only the product name, locates the Semantic module by naming convention, reads the module registry, then explores entities and relationships: and is autonomous from there. The discovery entities and the naming convention are defined in the [Semantic module standard](../modules/semantic.md); the platform queries live in `implementation/`. In a composition without Semantic (e.g. a Data Asset), discovery degrades to the platform catalogue plus `RichMetadata`.

**Consumable-object metadata.** Entity and relationship discovery answer *what exists and how it connects*; they do not, on their own, answer *which object a consumer should actually query*. A platform's security model may expose one entity through several objects (locking, business, current views), and a product may publish composite ("enriched") objects that join several entities into one consumable unit. Which object to query, what it represents, and what a composite encapsulates are **access-layer** facts, carried by the Semantic module's access-object metadata so a consumer resolves a queryable object to its meaning **once, from metadata**, never by parsing definitions or recomputing lineage at query time. Two principles govern it: **object names are not a contract** (role, layer, and entity are asserted in metadata, never inferred from a name), and the registry is **established once, at deployment**, from verifiable structure. This is discovery metadata, distinct from the security [Access Layer](#9-access-layer) that governs roles and grants; the schema and consumption contract are in the [Semantic module standard](../modules/semantic.md).

---

## 8. Self-Containment and Naming

Each data product is **self-contained and independently deployable**. Whatever stores it includes live within the product, discovery metadata in its own Semantic store, documentation in its own Memory store, with no shared cross-product database (`INV-MASTER-003`).

Because many products may share one platform, container names must be unique per product and must signal the owning module. The *principle*, unique, module-signalling, product-scoped names with clear module boundaries, is fixed here. The concrete naming scheme, and whether modules occupy separate containers or share one, is governed by the [object-placement pattern](../patterns/object-placement.md) and bound per platform. Object names are **environment-agnostic**: promotion substitutes the container, never renames the object (`INV-MASTER-006`).

---

## 9. Access Layer

A composition deployed for consumption **must** include an Access Layer. Without it a correctly deployed product is operationally invisible: every consumer is denied access no matter how complete the modules are (`INV-MASTER-004`).

Three standard roles are created per product, named `{ProductName}_ROLE_{TIER}`:

| Role | Consumers | Purpose |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{ProductName}_ROLE_READ` | Analysts, BI tools, ad-hoc users | Read access to module containers. |
| `{ProductName}_ROLE_AGENT` | AI agents, automated tools | Read access, kept separate for independent lifecycle management. |
| `{ProductName}_ROLE_ADMIN` | Product owner, data steward | Read access across all containers. |

The roles are product artefacts owned by the product team; assigning users is an operational event. Where a product separates base tables from views, consumers are granted the view layer only. The role model and grant timing are defined by the [access-layer pattern](../patterns/access-layer.md); the grant syntax lives in `implementation/`.

---

## 10. Deployment Sequence

Modules deploy in dependency order: but only those the composition includes. When Memory and Semantic are present they come first, because every other module writes documentation and discovery metadata into them as it deploys.

**Deploy order is not design order.** They run opposite ways, and reading one as the other is the easiest mistake to make here. A design starts with Domain, because every other module models references to its entities and cannot be specified until they exist. A deployment starts with Memory and Semantic, because every other module needs somewhere to register as it lands. Design Domain first; deploy it third.

| Phase | Deploy (if in composition) | Why |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Infrastructure** | Memory, then Semantic | Memory hosts documentation; Semantic hosts the discovery map. Both, when present, precede other modules. |
| **1.5a. Implied grants** | The cross-container rights the access layer needs to compile views | A build dependency, not an operational one: it needs only ownership of the containers, and everything downstream fails without it. |
| **1.5b. Access (initial)** | Create the three roles; grant read on the deployed infrastructure stores | Minimum grant for agents and tools to discover and read. Usually needs elevated privilege, so it is kept separable. |
| **2. Foundation** | Domain, then Observability | Domain is the entity foundation; Observability begins monitoring immediately. |
| **2.5. Access (extend)** | Extend grants to Domain + Observability | Consumers can now reach the foundation. |
| **3. Enhancement** | Search, Prediction | Both hard-require Domain to embed / featurise; grants extended as each deploys. |

A composition that omits a module simply omits its phase. A Data Asset runs Phase 1 (Memory documentation facet), 1.5, 2 (Domain), and Access: no Semantic, Search, Prediction, or Observability.

---

## 11. Design Standards and Platform Implementation

The framework is split along one boundary, defined by the [Design Language](DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md):

- **`design/`**: platform-agnostic. This document, the module standards, and the patterns. Written in logical types, capabilities, and invariants; no platform SQL (enforced by the linter).
- **`implementation/{platform}/`**: platform-specific. The concrete bindings, data types, DDL, queries, access grants, that satisfy the design. Teradata is the current reference; new platforms (Postgres, DuckDB) are added as sibling directories, changing no design document.

A platform "profile" *is* an `implementation/{platform}/` tree: platform capabilities can evolve, and new platforms can be added, without touching the structural standards.

---

## 12. Capturing the Design

Every design decision a product makes is **recorded as part of designing it**, not reconstructed afterwards. The obligation applies to every module and every design task, so it is stated once here.

**What is captured.** The settled decisions (each catalogued decision the composition raised, the option chosen, and, where it was not the advocated one, the reason), the module registry entry and version, the business-glossary terms the design introduces, at least one query-cookbook recipe per module, and a change-log entry. Decisions carry the id convention `DD-<MODULE>-<NNN>` and one of the standard categories: `ARCHITECTURE`, `SCHEMA`, `NAMING`, `PERFORMANCE`, `SECURITY`, `INTEGRATION`, `OPERATIONAL`.

**Where the record goes** depends on the composition. Whether it is written does not:

| Memory's `documentation` facet | Destination |
|---|---|
| Present | The product's own Memory store, via `DocumentationCapture`: the product is self-describing, and the record travels with it. |
| Absent | A design record kept alongside the product as a Markdown document, carrying the same content. |

**`DocumentationCapture` is a `[soft]` requirement** for exactly this reason. A composition without Memory does not fail; it loses the in-product destination, not the record itself. Decisions that were never written down cannot be reviewed or explained, and a reviewer meeting them later cannot tell a deliberate departure from an oversight.

The record definitions, capture workflow, and templates are owned by the Memory module design and its binding; they are not restated here.

---

## 13. Framework Invariants

Product-level rules every conforming composition satisfies. Several are **conditional** on which modules the composition includes.

- `INV-MASTER-001`: no module duplicates content owned by another; cross-module references are by `Identifier` with join-back.
- `INV-MASTER-002`: *when a Semantic module is present*, every other deployed module registers its entities, columns, and relationships in it; *when Memory's documentation facet is present*, every module records its documentation there.
- `INV-MASTER-003`: a product is self-contained. Whatever discovery and documentation stores it includes live within the product, and there is no shared cross-product database.
- `INV-MASTER-004`: a composition deployed for consumption includes an Access Layer (the three roles); without it the product is operationally invisible.
- `INV-MASTER-005`: structural standards are platform-neutral; every platform specific lives in `implementation/{platform}/` and changes no design document.
- `INV-MASTER-006`: object names are environment-agnostic; promotion substitutes the container and never renames the object.
- `INV-MASTER-007`: a composition is valid only if every `[hard]` capability requirement is satisfied within it (or by the platform); unmet `[soft]` requirements disable dependent features but do not invalidate the composition.
