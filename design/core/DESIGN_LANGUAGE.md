# Design Language

## AI-Native Data Product Architecture: Foundational Notation

---

## Document Control

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Status** | STANDARD |
| **Type** | Core (Foundational Notation) |
| **Scope** | All `design/` documents: modules and patterns |
| **Audience** | Designers authoring design standards; builders binding them to a platform; the validation linter |

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **notation and vocabulary** used by every document under `design/`. It exists so that design standards can describe **what** a module or pattern must be and **why**, without committing to **how** any one platform implements it.

`design/` is platform-agnostic. `implementation/{platform}/` is platform-specific. This document is the contract between the two: it defines the logical vocabulary that design documents write in, and that each platform implementation binds to concrete syntax.

The four building blocks are:

1. **Logical types**: a fixed vocabulary of attribute types with platform-neutral *semantics* (see Logical Type Vocabulary).
2. **Capability contracts**: named *operations* a design requires, which each platform binds to its own mechanism (see Capability Contracts).
3. **Invariants**: testable, platform-neutral *rules* a conforming implementation must satisfy (see Invariants).
4. **Decisions**: named *choices* a design must make explicitly, each with an advocated default and stated criteria for departing from it (see Decisions).

Every document also carries **frontmatter** (see Frontmatter): a short machine-readable header that makes the corpus navigable without any document having to name another by filename. It carries identity only; substance stays in the body (see What frontmatter is not for).

Design documents are written as **interface specifications**: they declare what an implementation must provide. Implementation documents are **conforming implementations**: they provide it. This mirrors the style already established by the pattern specs (`object-placement`, `physical-storage`).

---

## 2. The Design / Implementation Boundary

Every sentence in a design document must pass one test:

> **Would this sentence change if the target platform changed from Teradata to Postgres to DuckDB?**
>
> - **No**: it stays true on every platform → it belongs in `design/`.
> - **Yes**: it changes with the platform → it belongs in `implementation/{platform}/`.

The one-line rule: **semantics stay, syntax moves.**

| Belongs in `design/` (semantics) | Belongs in `implementation/` (syntax) |
|---|---|
| "Store the entity reference only; join back to Domain for content." | The concrete `INNER JOIN ... ON ...` query. |
| "Cosine is the default distance metric for text embeddings." | The `TD_VectorDistance(...)` call, or pgvector's `<=>` operator. |
| "Every attribute carries descriptive metadata." | `COMMENT ON COLUMN ...`. |
| "A surrogate key is stable across all versions of an entity." | `BIGINT` + keymap DDL, or `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`. |
| "The current version is retrievable by a single predictable filter." | `WHERE is_current = 1 AND is_deleted = 0`. |

### 2.1 The enforceable inclusion test

The boundary is enforced automatically: **a `design/` document must contain no platform SQL.** This is checked by the validation linter (`tooling/validation`) and defined precisely in the No-Platform-SQL Rule section. If a design document needs to show SQL to make its point, that SQL belongs in the matching implementation document instead.

---

## 3. Document Types

| `type` | Path | Written as | Contains |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core` | `design/core/` | Foundational reference | The notation, the vocabulary, the architecture-level design, the decision catalogue. |
| `module` | `design/modules/<anchor>.md` | Interface spec | Logical entity model + capabilities + invariants for one module. |
| `pattern` | `design/patterns/<anchor>.md` | Interface spec | A cross-cutting concern that requires a platform binding. |
| `implementation` | `implementation/<platform>/{modules,patterns}/<anchor>/` | Conforming implementation | The concrete DDL, queries, and bindings that satisfy the matching design document. |
| `platform-profile` | `implementation/<platform>/` | Platform reference | Physical-design conventions applying across every binding for one platform. |

**Identity is carried in frontmatter, not in prose.** Which documents exist and what each one is, is declared in frontmatter (see Frontmatter) and resolved by anchor: never by a hand-maintained list of filenames, which goes stale the moment a document is added. How documents *relate* (what they provide, require, and apply) is stated in the body, where it can carry its reasoning (see What frontmatter is not for); the generated catalogue reads it from there. Prose may link to another document for human navigation; what must not depend on a filename is the corpus structure itself. This document in particular names no module or pattern, so that adding one never requires editing the notation.

**Anchor-name parity is required.** A module with `anchor: search` lives at `design/modules/search.md` and is implemented at `implementation/<platform>/modules/search/`. A reviewer must be able to diff a design document against its binding one-to-one by anchor.

**Patterns are referenced, not re-encoded.** When a module depends on a cross-cutting concern, it *references the pattern by anchor* (see Entity Notation) rather than restating it. Re-stating a pattern inline in every module is the duplication this structure exists to remove.

### 3.1 The module spine

Every module document carries the same nine sections, so that an agent or a reviewer finds the same concern in the same place in any of them:

**Purpose · Scope and Boundaries · Entity Model · Applied Patterns · Capabilities and Composition · Integration with Other Modules · Invariants · Designer Responsibilities · Implementation**

A module adds its own sections wherever they belong, and numbers them as it likes; a section may carry a subtitle after a colon (`Entity Model: Runtime Facet`). What is fixed is that these nine are present under these names. The linter checks presence and naming, never order or number.

**References name sections, never number them.** A cross-document reference cites the document; an intra-document reference names the section. Numbering is then free to change without breaking a single reference, and with the spine consistent a named reference is enough for anything reading the corpus to find its target.

### 3.2 Frontmatter

Every **design document** opens with a YAML frontmatter block, delimited by `---`, before any Markdown. It is the machine-readable identity of the document: the linter validates it, and navigation is derived from it.

A design document is a core, module, or pattern document under `design/`, a platform profile, or the binding document at the root of an implementation directory. Directory-level navigation files (`README.md` at a hierarchy root) and supporting material inside a binding directory are not design documents and carry no frontmatter: they describe or support the corpus rather than forming part of it.

```yaml
---
title: Search Module
anchor: search
type: module              # core | module | pattern | implementation | platform-profile
status: standard          # draft | standard | deprecated
version: 2.0
normative: true           # false marks the document advisory, not conformance-binding
implements: search        # implementation documents only: the design anchor satisfied
platform: teradata        # implementation and platform-profile documents only
supersedes: []            # anchors this document replaces, when deprecating
---
```

**Required of every document:** `title`, `anchor`, `type`, `status`, `version`, `normative`. **Required of `implementation` documents additionally:** `implements`, `platform`. **Optional:** `supersedes`.

Two rules make the corpus resolvable, both enforced by the linter:

1. `anchor` must match the document's filename (or, for a binding, its directory name).
2. Every anchor named in `implements` or `supersedes` must resolve to a document that exists.

### 3.3 What frontmatter is not for

Frontmatter says what a document is and where it sits. It does not say what the document contains. The substance (the capabilities a document provides and requires, the patterns it applies, the decisions a designer must settle) lives in the body, where it can carry the reasoning that makes it useful.

The boundary is deliberate. A capability graph stated in both a header and a body table is two things to maintain and two things to disagree; the graph in `domain.md` did disagree with its own table within a day of being written. The body table is the better place for it because it has room for a *why* column, and for a provider that is genuinely `self` *or* `platform`, which a flat list silently drops.

Machine access does not argue for a header either. An agent traversing the corpus wants the capability graph once, in the generated catalogue, rather than reassembled from fifteen separate headers. The catalogue is built by reading the body tables, so the graph stays machine-readable without any document restating it.

Underneath all of this: **these documents are standards, not designs.** A standard's header identifies it so an agent can find it. The notation defined here (entity models, capability contracts, invariants, decisions) is the vocabulary a *data product's own design* is written in. Pushing a product-shaped description into a standard's header confuses the two.

---

## 4. Logical Type Vocabulary

Design documents describe attributes using these logical types only. Each has fixed semantics here; each platform declares its concrete binding in `implementation/{platform}/patterns/type-bindings/` (or its equivalent). Design documents never write a platform data type.

| Logical type | Semantics | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Identifier` | System-generated surrogate key. Unique, stable, never reused, never recycled. | For entities that are reference targets, allocated via the **surrogate-key-allocation** pattern so the value is stable across all versions: not by inline auto-increment. |
| `NaturalKey` | Business identifier sourced from an originating system. User- and report-facing. | Distinct from `Identifier`: `NaturalKey` comes from the source; `Identifier` is assigned internally. |
| `Reference -> <Entity>` | A pointer to another entity instance. | Names its target. Carries no content of the target: content is obtained by joining back (see `EntityJoinBack` capability). |
| `Code` | A short controlled-vocabulary value drawn from a reference set. | e.g. a type or status code. Backed by a Reference entity. |
| `ShortText` | Bounded human-readable string, short (names, labels). | Bound length is an implementation choice. |
| `Text` | Bounded human-readable string, medium (descriptions, notes). | |
| `LongText` | Large human-readable string (documents, content bodies). | |
| `Json` | A structured document value with a nested or flexible schema, stored whole and processed by the consumer rather than decomposed into columns. | Use for genuinely variable or nested context; never to avoid modelling stable attributes that deserve their own logical types. |
| `Enum{A\|B\|C}` | A value from a small closed set fixed at design time. | Lists its members inline. Use `Code` instead when the set is data-driven or governed as reference data. |
| `Integer` | Whole number (counts, ordinals, dimensions). | |
| `Decimal(p,s)` | Exact fixed-point number (money, rates). | Precision/scale are semantic and stay in design. |
| `Timestamp` | A point in time, **zone-aware**: the value fixes an instant, not a wall-clock reading. Stored normalised to UTC; presentation in a local zone is a consumer concern. | Precision is an implementation choice. A design that genuinely needs a zone-naive wall-clock value must declare `DEC-TIMESTAMP-ZONE` and record the assumed zone: it is never the silent default. |
| `Date` | A calendar date with no time component. | |
| `Flag` | A two-state indicator (yes/no, current/superseded, active/deleted). | Binds to whatever boolean-like type the platform prefers. |
| `Vector[dim]` | A dense numeric embedding of fixed dimensionality `dim`. | `dim` is semantic (tied to the embedding model) and stays in design; the storage format is an implementation choice. |

The vocabulary is intentionally small and closed. If a design genuinely needs a type not listed here, add it to this table first (with semantics), so the linter and every implementation can recognise it.

---

## 5. Entity Notation

Design documents declare structure in a keyword-free pseudo-notation. It carries logical structure, entities, attributes, keys, references, applied patterns, invariants, capabilities, and deliberately cannot express a physical table.

```
Entity: <Name>                    [kind: History | Reference | Relationship | Keymap]
  <attribute>: <LogicalType> [qualifiers]  // <business description>
  ...

  Keys:
    surrogate: <attribute>
    natural:   <attribute>

  Applies patterns:
    - <pattern-name>
    ...

  Requires capabilities:
    - <CapabilityName>
    ...

  Invariants:
    - INV-<MODULE>-<NNN>: <testable statement>
    ...
```

**Qualifiers** (zero or more per attribute):

| Qualifier | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[required]` | Must be present (non-null). |
| `[optional]` | May be absent. |
| `[unique]` | Unique within the entity (within the current version set, for versioned entities). |
| `[-> <Entity>]` | For a `Reference`: names the target entity. |
| `[pii]` | Carries personal or sensitive data; implementations must apply the platform's protection binding. |
| `[current-flag]` / `[deleted-flag]` | Marks the indicator used by the `CurrentStateFilter` capability. |

**Entity kinds** map to recurring shapes: `History` (a versioned business entity), `Reference` (a controlled vocabulary / lookup set), `Relationship` (an association between two entities), `Keymap` (a surrogate-key allocation table), `Record` (an append-oriented operational log or state entry, not SCD-versioned). Kinds are semantic labels, not table types.

### 5.1 Worked shape

```
Entity: Party                     [kind: History]
  party_id: Identifier  // surrogate, stable across all versions
  party_key: NaturalKey [required] [unique]  // business identifier from source system
  legal_name: ShortText [optional]  // registered legal name
  tax_id: ShortText [optional] [pii]  // tax identifier

  Keys:
    surrogate: party_id
    natural:   party_key

  Applies patterns:
    - temporal-lifecycle-metadata
    - object-placement

  Requires capabilities:
    - CurrentStateFilter
    - NaturalKeyLookup
    - SurrogateKeyAllocation
    - RichMetadata

  Invariants:
    - INV-DOMAIN-001: every attribute carries descriptive metadata.
    - INV-DOMAIN-002: the current version of an entity is retrievable by a single predictable filter.
```

Notice what is *absent*: no data types, no `CREATE`, no index clause, no temporal columns. The temporal columns come from the referenced `temporal-lifecycle-metadata` pattern; the physical index comes from `object-placement` / the platform. Those live in `implementation/teradata/modules/domain/`.

---

## 6. Capability Contracts

A capability is a named **operation a design requires**, declared abstractly. The design says *what must be possible*; each platform implementation says *how*. Capabilities are where otherwise platform-specific behaviour (vector search, in-database embedding) becomes platform-neutral in design.

A design document lists the capabilities it requires. Each platform implementation provides a **binding table** mapping each capability to its concrete mechanism.

### 6.1 Standard capability catalogue

| Capability | Contract | Illustrative bindings (implementation-owned) |
|---|---|---|
| `CurrentStateFilter` | Retrieve only current, non-deleted versions of an entity via a single predictable filter. | current/deleted flag predicate. |
| `PointInTimeReconstruction` | Retrieve an entity's state as it was at a given `Timestamp`. | temporal-range predicate; snapshot / time-travel. |
| `SurrogateKeyAllocation` | Allocate an `Identifier` that is stable across all versions of the same real-world entity. | keymap table; central sequence; managed identity. |
| `NaturalKeyLookup` | Retrieve an entity by its `NaturalKey`. | indexed equality lookup. |
| `EntityJoinBack` | From a row in any module, obtain the referenced Domain entity's content. | foreign-key join to the Domain entity. |
| `RichMetadata` | Attach descriptive, agent-readable metadata to every object and attribute. | column/table comments; catalogue metadata. |
| `AccessView` | Expose a predictable, named view of current (and optionally enriched) records with an explicit column contract. | view with declared column list. |
| `SoftDelete` | Mark an entity instance deleted without destroying its history: the instance stops satisfying `CurrentStateFilter`, remains reachable by `PointInTimeReconstruction`, and the deletion itself is an observable event. | deleted-flag predicate; the flag update as a versioning operation. |
| `ChangeEventCapture` | Record who changed an entity instance, when, and why, as a queryable event separate from the instance itself. | insert into the Observability change-event entity. |
| `LineageCapture` | Record the origin of an entity instance: source system, source record, and the run that produced it. | insert into the Observability lineage entities. |
| `AgentOutcomeCapture` | Record which tables and agent touched, when, and with what outcome, as a queryable event separate from the tables themselves. | insert into the Observability `AgentOutcome` entity. |
| `QualityScore` | Obtain a reliability score in `0.00`-`1.00` for an entity instance or set, decomposed into the rule categories that produced it, so an agent can judge fitness before use. | quality metric entity plus a scoring view. |
| `MetadataCoverageCheck` | Confirm programmatically that every attribute carries metadata. | catalogue query returning uncommented columns. |
| `SemanticRegistration` | Register the module's entities, columns, and relationships in the product's Semantic map so agents can discover them. | inserts into the Semantic discovery entities. |
| `DocumentationCapture` | Record the module's design decisions, glossary terms, and change history in the product's Memory store. | inserts into the Memory documentation entities. |
| `AgentContinuity` | Carry agent state across sessions: retrieve prior sessions, interactions, learned strategies, and preferences for a given scope, so an agent resumes rather than restarts. | inserts and reads over the Memory runtime entities. |
| `NearestNeighbors(query, candidates, metric, k)` | Return the `k` candidates most similar to `query` under a distance `metric`, as ranked `(id, distance)`. | vector-distance function; nearest-neighbour operator. |
| `ApproxIndex{IVF\|HNSW}` | *(Optional)* Accelerate `NearestNeighbors` with an approximate index of the named family. | IVF/KMEANS index; HNSW graph index. |
| `Embed(text, model)` | Produce a `Vector[dim]` for `text` using the named embedding `model`. | in-database embedding; external embedding API. |
| `GraphNativeLineageTraversal` | Traverse a product's lineage and access history as a graph: upstream/downstream trace, impact analysis, and access-path traversal over nodes and directed edges. | graph-explorer-conformant node/edge adapter views plus catalogue registration. |
| `ColumnGrainLineageTraversal` | *(Optional)* Traverse column-to-column derivation edges within a product's lineage graph, in addition to table-grain trace. | graph-explorer `COLUMN` node category and `derives_column` edge type, catalogue-registered only where the providing module's column-lineage facet is enabled. |

A capability marked *optional* (like `ApproxIndex`) may be unsatisfied on a given platform without breaking conformance: the design must not assume it is always present. This matters where platforms genuinely differ (e.g. in-database `Embed` exists on some platforms and is API-only on others): declare such capabilities optional or pluggable rather than assumed, so a "platform-agnostic" design does not quietly encode one platform's assumptions.

Capabilities not in this catalogue may be introduced by a design document, but must be defined there with the same contract shape (name, inputs, outputs, guarantee) so implementations can bind them unambiguously.

### 6.2 Provision, requirement, and composition

The framework is a **library of modules** that compose into different data design patterns: a minimal governed data asset, a traditional data product, a full AI-native data product, or an add-on to something that already exists. Modules must therefore function independently and in any valid combination. This works because every module declares both sides of its capability relationships.

A module design document declares, at module level:

- **Provides**: capabilities the module makes available to other modules or to agents (Domain provides `EntityJoinBack`; Search provides `NearestNeighbors`; Semantic provides `SemanticRegistration`; Memory provides `DocumentationCapture`).
- **Requires**: capabilities the module consumes, each tagged with a **strength** and a **provider**:
  - Strength: `[hard]` (the module cannot function without it; its absence makes the module undeployable) or `[soft]` (used when available; its absence disables the dependent feature, but the module still functions).
  - Provider: `self` (the module and its platform binding), `module:<Name>` (another module in the composition), `platform`, or `external`.

**Facets.** A module may expose named **facets** that can be enabled independently: for example Memory's `documentation` facet (the design-memory / documentation store) versus its `runtime` facet (agent state and learning). A capability may be provided by a facet; enabling the facet enables the capability. A composition may include a module with only some of its facets.

**Composition.** A composition is a chosen set of modules (and facets) assembled into a data design pattern. A composition is **valid** if and only if every `[hard]` requirement is satisfied by a `Provides` within the composition (or by `platform`). An unmet `[soft]` requirement never invalidates a composition: it simply disables that feature (graceful degradation). The named standard compositions, and the modules each includes, are catalogued in the [Master Design](MASTER_DESIGN.md).

---

## 7. Invariants

An invariant is a rule that every conforming implementation must satisfy, written so it can be **checked**. Invariants replace prose principles ("store IDs only") with testable statements.

**ID convention:** `INV-<MODULE>-<NNN>`, e.g. `INV-SEARCH-001`. `<MODULE>` is the uppercase module or pattern anchor name; `<NNN>` is a zero-padded sequence unique within that document.

**Writing invariants:**

- State a condition that is true or false of an implementation: not a recommendation.
- Keep it platform-neutral (it must hold on every platform).
- Prefer statements a query or a test can evaluate.

Examples:

- `INV-SEARCH-001`: an embedding record contains no attribute owned by the Domain module (keys only: no content duplication).
- `INV-SEARCH-002`: every embedding references exactly one current Domain entity.
- `INV-DOMAIN-001`: every attribute of every entity carries descriptive metadata.
- `INV-DOMAIN-002`: the current version of an entity is retrievable by a single predictable filter.

Each invariant should have a corresponding check in the module's implementation (a `MetadataCoverageCheck`-style query, a linter rule, or a unit test) so "is this implementation conforming?" becomes a green/red result rather than a judgement call.

---

## 8. Decisions

Not everything a design must settle is a conformance requirement. Some things are genuine **choices**: bi-temporal or single-dimension history, soft delete or hard delete, quality scores stored inline or offloaded. There is a recommended answer for each, but the recommendation is not universal: a small reference table and a hundred-million-row entity warrant different answers.

Written as advocated guidance, this material sits outside the design workflow. Nothing then records which option a design chose, and nothing can check that the implementation matches it. A decision closes both gaps by making the choice a declared, checkable part of the design.

**A decision is a named choice with an advocated default and stated criteria for departing from it.**

### 8.1 Notation

```
Decision: DEC-<TOPIC>
  Question:   <what must be settled>
  Applies to: <module | pattern | entity kind | product>

  Option: <option-name>            [advocated]
    Summary:      <what choosing this means>
    Implies:      <capabilities required / patterns applied when chosen>
    Acceptable when: <criteria; always satisfiable for the advocated option>

  Option: <option-name>
    Summary:      <what choosing this means>
    Implies:      <capabilities required / patterns applied when chosen>
    Acceptable when: <the conditions under which this is a sound choice>
    Requires:     <what must additionally be recorded to justify it>
```

**ID convention:** `DEC-<TOPIC>`, uppercase, unique across the corpus. Decisions are catalogued in one `core` document so that a designer meets the full set in one place; individual module and pattern documents declare their choices rather than restating the options.

### 8.2 Where a module states its decisions

A standard does not *make* these choices: a product does. What a module or pattern document carries is the list of decisions a designer must settle for it, each with the option this standard recommends and the question that shifts the answer. That list lives under **Designer Responsibilities**, in a table of this shape:

| Decision | Recommended | Settle it by asking |
|---|---|---|
| `DEC-TEMPORAL-PATTERN` | `bi-temporal` | Do features need point-in-time correctness? Do corrections arrive late? |
| `DEC-DELETE-STRATEGY` | `soft-delete` | Is there an audit obligation, a feature, or an analysis that depends on deletions? |

Where a module recommends something other than the catalogue's advocated option, the row says why: a standard that quietly departs from its own recommendation is exactly the drift this construct exists to surface.

It belongs under Designer Responsibilities rather than in a header because that is where a designer meets it. The design skill reads these tables and opens the conversation: it walks the human designer through each decision at design time, and records the answer in the product's design.

### 8.3 Where a product states its choices

The **product's** design document records what was actually chosen, and that record is what the implementation is checked against. A choice that departs from the recommendation carries its reason, in the design, where a reviewer will find it.

### 8.4 What makes a decision testable

A declared decision can be checked three ways:

1. **Complete**: a module that describes a versioned entity has to list how it versions and how it deletes. The linter fails a standard that leaves either unstated.
2. **Valid**: every decision named must exist in the catalogue, and every option recommended must be one that decision defines.
3. **Honoured**: a product's implementation must match the choice its design recorded. Choosing `soft-delete` and then binding a destructive delete is a conformance failure, checkable by the same machinery that checks invariants.

A decision therefore travels with the design instead of sitting beside it as advice. An agent reading a module knows what must be settled, and a reviewer can tell a deliberate departure from an oversight.

---

## 9. The No-Platform-SQL Rule (enforceable)

A `design/` document must contain no platform SQL. The validation linter enforces this. The rule is defined to catch real entanglement while not flagging ordinary English (the words "table", "view", "date", "index" are fine in prose).

A design document **fails** the linter if any of the following appear:

1. **A SQL-tagged fenced code block.** Fenced blocks tagged ` ```sql ` (or `tsql`, `plsql`, `psql`) are prohibited outright: design shows pseudo-notation, not SQL.
2. **SQL statements inside any fenced block.** Within any code block, a line beginning with a SQL statement keyword, `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `MERGE`, `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, is a violation. (The pseudo-notation in the Entity Notation section uses none of these, so it passes.)
3. **Platform data types or vendor tokens, anywhere.** High-precision tokens that are never ordinary English and only ever appear in SQL: `VARCHAR`, `BIGINT`, `BYTEINT`, `SMALLINT`, `DECIMAL(`, `FLOAT32`, `TIMESTAMP(`, `PRIMARY INDEX`, `UNIQUE PRIMARY INDEX`, `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`, `NOT NULL`, `DEFAULT `, `COMMENT ON`, and any `TD_`-prefixed function. Use the logical types of the Logical Type Vocabulary section instead.

**Escape hatch.** A core/meta document that must legitimately name SQL (this document; the linter's own README) carries an ignore directive on its first line:

```
<!-- design-lint: ignore-file (reason) -->
```

Module and pattern documents must never use the ignore directive: they are the content the rule exists to keep clean.

The exact token lists live with the linter (`tooling/validation`) so the linter and this document stay in agreement; The No-Platform-SQL Rule is the human-readable statement of what that linter enforces.

---

## 10. Authoring Checklist

Before a design document is considered conforming:

- [ ] Frontmatter is present, complete, and identity-only; `anchor` matches the filename (see Frontmatter).
- [ ] Every attribute uses a logical type from the Logical Type Vocabulary section (no platform types).
- [ ] Structure is expressed in the Entity Notation (no `CREATE`/`SELECT`).
- [ ] Cross-cutting concerns are **referenced** by pattern anchor, not restated inline.
- [ ] Every required behaviour is expressed as a capability (see Capability Contracts), not as a concrete query.
- [ ] Principles are written as testable invariants with `INV-<MODULE>-<NNN>` ids (see Invariants).
- [ ] Every decision the design must settle is listed under Designer Responsibilities, and any recommendation departing from the advocated option says why (see Where a module states its decisions).
- [ ] No other document is referred to by filename: cross-references resolve by anchor.
- [ ] The matching implementation provides a binding for every capability and satisfies every invariant.
- [ ] The document passes the validation linter (see The No-Platform-SQL Rule) with no ignore directive.

**End of Design Language**
