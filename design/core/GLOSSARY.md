## AI-Native Data Product Architecture: Shared Vocabulary

Terms used across the design standards. Notation terms (logical types, capabilities, invariants, and decisions) are defined authoritatively in the [Design Language](DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md); the entries here give the short definition and point at it. This glossary covers the architectural and domain vocabulary.

---

**Access Layer**: The mandatory access-control artefact of a data product. Creates the three standard roles (`ROLE_READ`, `ROLE_AGENT`, `ROLE_ADMIN`) and grants them read access to module containers, so the product can be discovered and queried. Deployed in two phases interleaved with the module sequence. See the [access-layer pattern](../patterns/access-layer.md).

**Advocated option**: The recommended answer to a **Decision**. Choosing it needs no justification; choosing another option requires a recorded reason. Advocacy is not mandate: what conformance requires is that the choice be *declared*, not that it match the recommendation. See the [decision catalogue](ADVOCATED_STANDARDS.md).

**Agent**: An autonomous software entity that perceives, reasons, and acts, consuming data products to achieve goals without human mediation.

**Anchor**: The short name that identifies a module or pattern across the corpus, declared in its **frontmatter** and matching the document's location. Anchors are how documents reference each other: a design document and its platform binding share one, so either path is computable from the other without a lookup table. Cross-references resolve by anchor, never by filename.

**Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**: A structured record of a significant design decision: context, alternatives, rationale, consequences. Captured in the Memory module's design-decision store. Distinct from a **Decision**: an ADR is a *product's* record of something it settled; a Decision is a *catalogued* choice the framework poses to every product.

**Attribute**: A field of an entity. For example, `party_key` is an attribute of the Party entity. Typed with the [logical vocabulary](DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md).

**Capability**: A named operation a design requires, declared abstractly and bound per platform. See the [capability catalogue](DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md).

**Co-location**: A platform's ability to store related data together so joins avoid data movement. A physical optimisation; its availability and mechanism are platform-specific.

**Composition**: A chosen set of modules (and **facets**) assembled into a data design pattern. The framework is a library rather than a fixed architecture. A composition is *valid* when every `[hard]` requirement in it is satisfied by a `Provides` within it. An unmet `[soft]` requirement disables that feature and leaves the rest working. Domain is the root; Search and Prediction hard-depend on it; Semantic, Observability, and Memory are cross-cutting and soft. An AI-Native Data Product is the fullest composition, and other combinations are equally valid. See the [Design Language](DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md) for the mechanism and the [Master Design](MASTER_DESIGN.md) for the standard presets.

**Conformance**: Whether an implementation satisfies what the design requires of it: that every **invariant** holds, every conformance rule passes, every required **capability** has a binding, and every applicable **Decision** is declared. Conformance is deliberately checkable rather than a judgement call. Each requirement has a corresponding query, linter rule, or test, so the answer is a test result. *Advisory* content sits outside it by definition.

**Data Product**: A self-contained, well-defined data asset with clear ownership, interfaces, and contracts. It is owned and maintained in its own right.

**Decision**: A named choice a design must settle explicitly, carrying an **advocated option** and stated criteria for departing from it. The third construct alongside capabilities and invariants: where an invariant states what must be true of every implementation, a decision states what legitimately varies between them. Written `DEC-<TOPIC>`, catalogued in the [decision catalogue](ADVOCATED_STANDARDS.md), and declared in each document's frontmatter. See the [Design Language](DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md).

**Design / Implementation split**: The framework's core boundary: platform-agnostic standards in `design/`, platform-specific bindings in `implementation/{platform}/`. See the [Design Language](DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md).

**Documentation store**: The part of the Memory module that holds design memory (module registry, design decisions, business glossary, query cookbook, implementation notes, change log), co-located in the product's own Memory store so the product is self-contained.

**Embedding**: A dense vector representation of data (text, image, entity) in a high-dimensional space where semantic similarity maps to geometric proximity. The logical type is `Vector[dim]`.

**Entity**: A table-level object within the data product. `Party` is an entity; a specific Party row is an *instance*.

**Facet**: A named part of a module that can be enabled independently of the rest, so that a **composition** may take some of a module without taking all of it. Memory has two: the `documentation` facet (design memory: decisions, glossary, cookbook, change log) and the `runtime` facet (agent sessions, interactions, learned strategies). A capability provided by a facet becomes available when that facet is enabled.

**Feature Store**: A repository for storing, managing, and serving ML features with consistency between training and inference. The role of the Prediction module.

**Frontmatter**: The short YAML block opening every design document, declaring its identity: title, **anchor**, type, status, version, and normative classification. Identity only. What a document provides, requires, and asks a designer to settle lives in its body, where it can carry its reasoning. See the [Design Language](DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md).

**Identifier / Natural key**: `Identifier` is the internal, system-generated surrogate stable across an entity's versions; a `NaturalKey` is the business identifier from the source system. Every Domain entity carries both.

**Instance**: A single row within an entity. Party `CUST-123` is an instance of the Party entity.

**Invariant**: A testable, platform-neutral rule a conforming implementation must satisfy. Written `INV-<MODULE>-<NNN>`. See the [Design Language](DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md).

**Join-back**: The pattern by which a module obtains entity content: it stores an `Identifier` and joins back to the Domain entity, rather than duplicating content. Realised by the `EntityJoinBack` capability.

**Keymap**: An entity kind whose sole job is allocating an `Identifier` for a natural key, once, so the surrogate stays stable across every version of the same real-world thing. Allocating identifiers on the versioned entity itself gives each version a different one, which makes any reference held elsewhere ambiguous. The advocated option of `DEC-SURROGATE-ALLOCATION`; entities that are never themselves referenced may allocate directly and omit it.

**Knowledge Store**: Design-time knowledge that guides *how* to build a product (modelling standards, naming conventions, industry reference models). This is distinct from the runtime knowledge *about* a product, which lives in the Semantic module.

**Module**: A self-contained, independently deployable component responsible for a distinct capability. The six standard modules are Domain, Search, Prediction, Observability, Semantic, and Memory. Modules integrate through join-back and cross-module reference patterns.

**Normative / advisory**: A document's conformance weight, declared in its **frontmatter**. *Normative* content is required: violating it makes a product non-conformant. *Advisory* content is recommended but not required. Placement in the hierarchy is a navigation aid and never a substitute for the declaration.

**Platform profile**: A per-platform document collecting the physical-design conventions that apply across every binding for that platform: key strategy, partitioning, indexing, compression, statistics. Advisory rather than normative: it records recommended defaults, and a workload with different needs may deviate from them.

**Point-in-Time (PIT)**: Reconstructing data as it existed at a specific past moment. This is what makes ML features reproducible without leakage. Realised by the `PointInTimeReconstruction` capability.

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: A pattern where a language model retrieves relevant context before generating a response; requires the Search module.

**Reference (relationship)**: An association between entities, expressed as a reference attribute (`Reference -> <Entity>`), a hierarchy, or a semantic association.

**Semantic map**: The discovery metadata in the Semantic module (module registry, entity catalogue, column dictionary, relationship graph, path finder, naming standards) that lets an agent discover structure and generate valid queries autonomously.

**Soft delete**: Recording a deletion by marking the instance rather than destroying it: it leaves the current set, stays reachable historically, and the deletion is itself an observable event. The advocated option of `DEC-DELETE-STRATEGY`, realised by the `SoftDelete` capability. A destructive delete cannot answer which instances were removed, or when, so deletion is treated as information in its own right.

**Temporal data**: Data that tracks change over time, distinguishing *valid time* (when true in reality) from *transaction time* (when recorded). Governed by the [temporal-lifecycle-metadata pattern](../patterns/temporal-lifecycle-metadata.md).

**Trust map**: The per-area picture of what a product's validation has proven: for each area (a module, entity, pattern, or capability), which checks exist, which ran, what they found, and how far the result supports use. It informs rather than permits — no entry withholds use of the product — and it bounds what a failure costs to the area it belongs to. Defined by the [validation pattern](../patterns/validation.md); published by a validator into Observability, and built by hand by a reviewer before one exists.

**Vector store**: A store optimised for holding and searching high-dimensional vectors by similarity. On a given platform it may be a native capability or a specialist component; bound by the `NearestNeighbors` / `ApproxIndex` capabilities.
