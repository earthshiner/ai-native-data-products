# Temporal & Lifecycle Metadata: Pattern

## AI-Native Data Product Architecture

---

## Document Control

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Status** | STANDARD |
| **Type** | Pattern (cross-cutting, platform-agnostic) |
| **Scope** | Every persisted table in every module: temporal and lifecycle metadata |
| **Extends** | [Master Design](../core/MASTER_DESIGN.md) |
| **Notation** | [Design Language](../core/DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md) |
| **Implementations** | [`implementation/teradata/patterns/temporal-lifecycle-metadata/`](../../implementation/teradata/patterns/temporal-lifecycle-metadata/) |

This pattern defines **semantic contracts only**: the canonical names and meanings of temporal and lifecycle metadata. It contains no platform types, sentinel literals, or catalogue queries; those bind in the implementation. It underpins the `CurrentStateFilter` and `PointInTimeReconstruction` capabilities, and its conformance rules are lifted directly by the [validation pattern](validation.md).

---

## 1. Purpose

Without a single temporal contract, products and standards drift apart in ways that break every consumer relying on a shared filter. One concept acquires competing spellings (`valid_from_dts` against bare `valid_from` or `effective_date`; `created_at` against `created_dts` or `created_date`). One flag carries two meanings, with `is_active` marking currency in one product and lifecycle state in another. Transaction time is mandated in one place and optional in the next, two open-state conventions coexist, and audit-only dialects leave consumers nothing to filter on at all.

This pattern gives each concept **exactly one name and one meaning**, defines the SCD2 period contract precisely, and makes each table declare which temporal profile it implements so validators enforce the contract mechanically.

---

## 2. Capabilities

**Provides:**

| Capability | Made available to |
|------------|-------------------|
| `CurrentStateFilter` | Every module with versioned entities: the canonical columns and flag semantics are what make "the current version" a single predictable filter. |
| `PointInTimeReconstruction` | Consumers reconstructing an entity as at a past instant, over the validity period this pattern defines. |
| `SoftDelete` | Modules recording deletion as a state rather than a destruction, via the lifecycle flag contract. |

**Requires:**

| Capability | Strength | Provider | Why |
|------------|----------|----------|-----|
| `RichMetadata` | `[hard]` | `self` / `platform` | Every temporal and lifecycle column carries a description, so an agent can resolve a table's temporal behaviour from metadata rather than inference. |
| `SemanticRegistration` | `[soft]` | `module:Semantic` | A table declares its temporal profile in the Semantic entity metadata, where validators read it. |

---

## 3. The Seven Temporal Concepts

Every temporal or lifecycle column represents exactly one of these. Conflating two concepts in one column is a conformance failure.

| # | Concept | Question it answers | Canonical columns |
|---|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Business validity** | During which real-world period was this version true? | `valid_from_dts`, `valid_to_dts` |
| 2 | **Row audit** | When did the platform physically create / last change this row? | `created_dts`, `updated_dts` |
| 3 | **Ingestion** | When was this data accepted at the ingestion boundary? | `ingested_dts` |
| 4 | **Event time** | When did the specific business/technical event occur? | `<event>_dts` (e.g. `measured_dts`, `run_dts`, `decided_dts`) |
| 5 | **SCD2 currency** | Is this the current version for its natural key? | `is_current` (convenience over concept 1) |
| 6 | **Logical deletion** | Does this version record deletion of the entity? | `is_deleted`, `deleted_dts` |
| 7 | **Lifecycle state** | Is this thing operationally live / approved for use, independent of versioning? | `is_active` |

**Transaction time** (`transaction_from_dts`, `transaction_to_dts`) is an optional bitemporal extension of concept 1 for full correction semantics: **not** part of the mandatory core.

---

## 4. Canonical Column Contract

### 4.1 Canonical columns

| Column | Meaning | Requirement |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `valid_from_dts` | Inclusive start of business validity | Required for SCD2 |
| `valid_to_dts` | **Exclusive** end of business validity | Required for SCD2 |
| `is_current` | Convenience indicator that the version is current | Required for SCD2 where stored flags are supported |
| `created_dts` | Physical row-version creation time | Required for governed persisted tables |
| `updated_dts` | Physical row last-change time | Required for governed persisted tables |
| `ingested_dts` | Time accepted at the ingestion boundary | Conditional |
| `is_deleted` | Logical deletion state | Required when deletion is supported |
| `deleted_dts` | Effective logical deletion time | Required when `is_deleted` is present |
| `is_active` | Domain/metadata lifecycle state, independent of currency and deletion | Conditional; semantics must be documented |
| `<event>_dts` | Named business/technical event time | Conditional on table grain |
| `transaction_from_dts` / `transaction_to_dts` | Database (transaction-time) validity | Optional: bitemporal variant only |

All `*_dts` columns are timestamp-grain (logical type `Timestamp`). Day-grain business facts (e.g. a contractual `decided_date`, logical type `Date`) remain legal as *event* columns, but validity bounds and audit columns are always timestamps. Precision, time-zone handling, and physical types bind per implementation.

### 4.2 Prohibited generic names

Prohibited in new designs; each has exactly one canonical replacement:

| Prohibited | Canonical | Scope |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| `created_at`, `created_timestamp`, `created_dt`, `created_date` (as audit) | `created_dts` | All profiles |
| `updated_at`, `updated_timestamp` | `updated_dts` | All profiles |
| `valid_from`, `effective_from`, `start_timestamp` | `valid_from_dts` | All profiles |
| `valid_to`, `effective_to`, `end_timestamp` | `valid_to_dts` | All profiles |
| `effective_date` | `valid_from_dts` | Prohibited except on `CURRENT_STATE` (see below) |
| `expiration_date` | `valid_to_dts` | Prohibited except on `CURRENT_STATE` (see below) |
| `deleted_flag`, `active_ind`, `*_yn`, single-character / Y-N flag encodings | `is_deleted` / `is_active` (a `Flag`) | All profiles |

Event-specific names remain valid where they describe distinct events rather than audit or SCD2 metadata: `run_dts`, `measured_dts`, `observation_dts`, `generated_dts`, `discovered_dts`, `change_dts`, `deployed_dts`, `registered_dts`, `retired_dts`, and similar.

**`effective_date` and `expiration_date` on a `CURRENT_STATE` entity.** These two names are prohibited wherever a validity pair exists for them to compete with, which is every versioned and event profile: there they reintroduce exactly the ambiguity this pattern exists to remove. On a `CURRENT_STATE` entity they are permitted, because the entity holds no history and there is no pair to confuse them with. What they carry there is a **day-grain business lifecycle date**, the period a code, rate, or classification is in force, which the canonical column contract already admits as an event column.

This turns on the *declared profile*, not on what kind of thing the table holds. A controlled vocabulary that versions declares `SCD2_HISTORY` and uses the canonical names like anything else; one that genuinely holds only present values declares `CURRENT_STATE` and may use these. Reading the name against the profile is what resolves it, which is the reading this pattern has always required: required and prohibited columns are declared per profile throughout.

`valid_from` and `valid_to` stay prohibited everywhere. Those are the SCD2 columns with the suffix removed, and there is no entity where that is what was meant.

---

## 5. Lifecycle Flag Semantics

Flags are `Flag`-typed (the implementation defines the physical representation, restricted to two values). Each answers exactly one question.

**5.1 `is_current`**: *"Is this the current SCD2 version for this natural key?"* The validity period remains **authoritative**; the flag is a consumer convenience. It changes transactionally with `valid_to_dts`; validation fails any disagreement; no more than one current row per natural key.

**5.2 `is_deleted`**: *"Does this version represent logical deletion?"* Not an expired historical version. `deleted_dts` required when true. Governed history is retained; deletion never rewrites it. Default current surfaces exclude deleted rows. Restoration creates a successor version.

**5.3 `is_active`**: an independently defined domain/metadata lifecycle state (e.g. a cookbook recipe approved for discovery, a lineage flow live, an agreement operationally in force). It must **not** alias `is_current` or `is_deleted`, must not be added mechanically to every table, and its meaning, owner, and allowed transitions must be documented: an undocumented `is_active` is a conformance failure.

> Where a table needs both version currency *and* an approval/discoverability state (common for curated registries such as glossaries and cookbooks), use `is_current` for currency and `is_active` for approval: never one flag for both.

---

## 6. SCD2 Period Contract

### 6.1 Period semantics

Business validity uses **half-open** periods:

```text
[valid_from_dts, valid_to_dts)
```

A row is valid at instant `t` when:

```text
valid_from_dts <= t  AND  t < valid_to_dts
```

The end bound is exclusive. Adjacent versions share a boundary instant (`predecessor.valid_to_dts = successor.valid_from_dts`) with no gap and no overlap. Half-open semantics prohibit inclusive-end failure modes: no inclusive end dates, no current-date-minus-one, no second-subtraction, no precision-dependent end conventions.

### 6.2 Required invariants

1. Both validity boundaries are non-null.
2. `valid_from_dts < valid_to_dts`: no zero-duration or negative periods.
3. Periods for one natural key do not overlap.
4. No more than one current row exists per natural key.
5. `is_current` agrees with the open-ended validity representation.
6. Unchanged input does not create another version (change detection is mandatory).
7. Predecessor closure and successor insertion occur in one transaction.
8. Replay is idempotent: reprocessing the same input produces no new versions.
9. Late-arriving changes are placed at their actual effective instant, splitting existing periods.
10. Logical deletion preserves governed history: a deletion is a new current version with `is_deleted` set and `deleted_dts` recorded.

### 6.3 Bitemporal extension (optional)

Products requiring correction semantics ("what did we believe on date X about date Y?") add `transaction_from_dts` / `transaction_to_dts` with the same half-open semantics on the transaction-time axis. Corrections close the transaction period of the mistaken row and insert corrected rows; business validity is never destructively rewritten. Transaction time is an **optional profile variant**, never part of the mandatory core: `created_dts` / `updated_dts` already provide physical audit time.

---

## 7. Table Metadata Profiles

Every persisted table **declares exactly one profile**. The declaration lives in the Semantic module's entity metadata (a `temporal_pattern` descriptor, with current/deleted flag descriptors naming the physical flags where present), so agents and validators resolve a table's temporal behaviour from metadata rather than inference.

| Profile | Vocabulary value | Required | Prohibited |
|---------|------------------|----------|------------|
| Current-state table | `CURRENT_STATE` | `created_dts`, `updated_dts` | SCD2 validity pair, `is_current` |
| Append-only event / fact | `EVENT_APPEND_ONLY` | audit columns + ≥1 `<event>_dts` | lifecycle flags, SCD2 period (normally) |
| SCD2 history | `SCD2_HISTORY` | validity pair, `is_current`, audit columns |: (`is_deleted`/`is_active` only when applicable) |
| Association / bridge | `ASSOCIATION_CURRENT` or `ASSOCIATION_SCD2` | per the chosen underlying profile | per the chosen underlying profile |
| Operational log / audit | `OPERATIONAL_LOG` | audit + event timestamps | lifecycle / SCD2 columns unless the logged object is versioned |
| SCD2 bitemporal | `SCD2_BITEMPORAL` | SCD2 required columns + transaction-time pair | - |

Missing required columns, or prohibited columns present, are conformance failures for the declared profile.

**Entity kinds and their default profiles.** Every kind in the [entity notation](../core/DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md) resolves to a profile, so no persisted table falls outside this pattern:

| Kind | Default profile | Note |
|------|-----------------|------|
| `History` | `SCD2_HISTORY` (or `SCD2_BITEMPORAL` per `DEC-TEMPORAL-PATTERN`) | The versioned business entity. |
| `Relationship` | As the entities it associates: `ASSOCIATION_SCD2` or `ASSOCIATION_CURRENT` | |
| `Reference` | `SCD2_HISTORY` | A code's label and definition change; a past record must still decode against what its code meant then. A set that genuinely carries no history declares `CURRENT_STATE` and records the choice. |
| `Keymap` | `CURRENT_STATE` | One row per natural key, allocated once, never versioned. |
| `Record` | `EVENT_APPEND_ONLY` or `CURRENT_STATE` | Per what the record is. |

A kind that names no profile is a kind whose temporal columns are unowned, and unowned columns drift: that is how a validity pair acquires a second spelling.

---

## 8. Open-State Representation

Two different "still open" situations take different representations:

1. **Validity bounds are never null.** An open-ended current version carries the implementation's far-future **sentinel** in `valid_to_dts` (and `transaction_to_dts` where present). This keeps range predicates uniform and efficient.
2. **Event timestamps are null until the event occurs.** `deleted_dts`, `retired_dts`, `session_end_dts`, `validation_dts`, and similar record instants of events that may not yet have happened; `null` means "has not occurred". They are not validity bounds and must not carry sentinels.

---

## 9. Access Exposure Policy

The pattern defines two exposure **surfaces** per consumable entity. How each is realised (views, schemas, grants, or direct table access) is a platform decision bound in the implementation and governed by the [access-layer pattern](access-layer.md); every platform provides both surfaces, however thinly.

- The **governed full-contract surface** exposes every temporal and lifecycle column, for auditors, maintainers, and history-aware consumers.
- The **default current surface** per consumable entity: filters on authoritative current validity **plus** `is_current`; additionally excludes deleted rows when deletion is supported; hides `valid_to_dts`, `is_current`, deletion metadata, and operational audit timestamps by default; may expose `valid_from_dts` as "effective since"; exposes `is_active` only where business-meaningful; exposes event timestamps when part of the consumer contract.
- Historical and deletion-aware surfaces may expose additional metadata for approved use cases.
- Purpose-specific surfaces derive from the governed full-contract surface and must not apply temporal semantics that disagree with it.

---

## 10. Conformance Rules

Lifted directly into validator profiles by the [validation pattern](validation.md), scoped to this pattern's area or to the entity a data check resolves. Rules marked **[B]** carry CRITICAL/ERROR severity, which takes the area they fail in to `weak` confidence; the rest default to warning severity.

| Rule | Check |
|------|-------|
| TLM-01 **[B]** | Every persisted table declares exactly one profile (see Table Metadata Profiles) in the Semantic entity metadata. |
| TLM-02 **[B]** | All required columns for the declared profile exist. |
| TLM-03 | No prohibited columns for the declared profile exist. |
| TLM-04 | No prohibited generic names exist, resolved against the declared profile: `effective_date` / `expiration_date` are permitted on `CURRENT_STATE` and prohibited elsewhere. |
| TLM-05 | Physical type, precision, time-zone handling, and flag representation match the implementation. |
| TLM-06 **[B]** | Flags are non-null and restricted to the two values. |
| TLM-07 **[B]** | Validity bounds are non-null and `valid_from_dts < valid_to_dts`. |
| TLM-08 **[B]** | No overlapping validity periods per natural key. |
| TLM-09 **[B]** | At most one current row per natural key. |
| TLM-10 **[B]** | `is_current` agrees with the open-ended validity representation. |
| TLM-11 | `is_deleted` rows have a non-null `deleted_dts`. |
| TLM-12 | Every `is_active` column has documented semantics, owner, and transitions. |
| TLM-13 | Default current surfaces apply the filters (no deleted rows exposed). |
| TLM-14 | Purpose-specific surfaces agree with the governed full-contract surface's temporal semantics. |
| TLM-15 | Every temporal/lifecycle column carries a column comment (`RichMetadata`). |
| TLM-16 | No inclusive-end idioms (current-date-minus-one, second-subtraction) in maintenance code or surfaces. |
| TLM-17 | Sentinels appear only on validity bounds; event timestamps use `null` for "not yet occurred". |
| TLM-18 **[B]** | Every temporal column is zone-aware, per the advocated option of `DEC-TIMESTAMP-ZONE`. A table declaring the `zone-naive` option instead satisfies this rule only when its assumed zone is recorded in the Semantic entity metadata. |

---

## 11. Migration and Compatibility

**Legacy-to-canonical mapping** (forms found in existing products and their replacements): DATE-grain `valid_from`/`valid_to` and `effective_date`/`expiration_date` → `valid_from_dts`/`valid_to_dts` (grain widens day → timestamp), wherever they serve as validity bounds: reference data included, since a versioned code list is a versioned entity; `created_at`/`created_dt`/`created_timestamp`/`created_date` → `created_dts`; `updated_at`/`updated_timestamp` → `updated_dts`; `is_active`-as-currency → `is_current` (retain `is_active` only for a distinct documented approval state); audit-only dialects (`rec_load_dts`/`rec_updt_dts`) → canonical audit columns; transaction-time-as-mandatory → optional `SCD2_BITEMPORAL` variant.

**Migration rules:** new products apply the canonical contract immediately; deployed products migrate through **versioned compatibility projections** (a compatibility surface presenting canonical names over legacy columns until base tables are regenerated, consumers never parse dialects); widening alone cannot recover semantics (DATE→timestamp migrations document that intra-day ordering is unavailable for historical rows); validators flag non-canonical names on new objects while allowing registered legacy aliases with an expiry.

**Precedence.** Where any other design standard disagrees on the naming, typing, grain, sentinel, or lifecycle semantics of temporal metadata, this pattern takes precedence; a disagreeing document is aligned at its next revision.

---

## 12. Relationship to Other Standards

- **[Validation pattern](validation.md)**: rules are written to lift directly into validator profiles; a `[B]` rule failing takes its area to `weak` confidence on the published trust map.
- **[Object-placement pattern](object-placement.md)**: layer *naming* is owned by object placement; defines layer *responsibilities* only.
- **[Access-layer pattern](access-layer.md)**: realises the surfaces as concrete access objects.
- **[Semantic module](../modules/semantic.md)**: its entity metadata carries the profile declaration; its own catalogue tables follow the current-state or SCD2 profile.
- **Implementation**: the Teradata binding (types, sentinel, flag representation, DDL/DML templates, access views, catalogue conformance queries) lives in [`implementation/teradata/patterns/temporal-lifecycle-metadata/`](../../implementation/teradata/patterns/temporal-lifecycle-metadata/).

**End of Temporal & Lifecycle Metadata Pattern**
