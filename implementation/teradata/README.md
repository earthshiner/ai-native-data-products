# Teradata Implementation

Teradata's conforming implementation of the patterns and modules defined under [`design/`](../../design). Mirrors the design hierarchy by anchor name.

Physical-design conventions that apply across every binding here, primary index selection, partitioning, compression, statistics, live in [`PLATFORM_PROFILE.md`](PLATFORM_PROFILE.md).

---

## Structure

```
implementation/teradata/
├── patterns/   one directory per design/patterns/ anchor
└── modules/    one directory per design/modules/ anchor
```

Each pattern or module gets **its own directory** (e.g. `modules/domain/`) rather than a single top-level file, because an implementation is usually more than one artifact: a binding document plus one or more templates.

Adding a platform means creating a same-shaped sibling of this directory (`implementation/postgres/`, say), not inventing a new layout.

## Rendering the templates

**The `.sql.j2` templates are rendered, not pasted.** They import shared macros from each other, so a Jinja environment whose loader is rooted at *this directory* is what makes an import path resolve:

```python
from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader, StrictUndefined

env = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader("implementation/teradata"),
                  undefined=StrictUndefined)
sql = env.get_template("modules/domain/02-entity.sql.j2").render(**context)
```

Import paths are written relative to that root (`patterns/temporal-lifecycle-metadata/00-temporal-macros.sql.j2`), which is why a template opened on its own and search-replaced no longer produces deployable SQL: the macro call renders as nothing.

`StrictUndefined` is worth keeping. Without it a variable the template expects and the caller forgets renders as an empty string, and a `CREATE TABLE` missing a column name fails at the database with an error that points nowhere near the cause.

What this buys is that the cross-cutting columns are defined once. A table's temporal and lifecycle block comes from the [temporal pattern's macros](patterns/temporal-lifecycle-metadata/), the same way a design document references a pattern rather than restating it. Every template that renders is exercised by `tooling/validation/tests/test_templates_render.py`.

## What goes in a directory

Two kinds of artifact, distinguished by extension:

| Artifact | Extension | Contents |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Binding document** | `.md` | Prose. How this platform satisfies the design contract: physical model, type bindings, failure modes, deviations. Human-readable, never executed. |
| **Template** | `.sql.j2` | Jinja-templated DDL/DCL rendered at build time. Mostly-static SQL with placeholders for the part that varies per product. |

Most anchors need a binding document. Only some need a template. An anchor whose platform behaviour is fully described in prose does not need a `.sql.j2` file, and one should not be created speculatively.

## Naming

- The **binding document** is `README.md` at the root of the anchor directory. `patterns/validation/README.md` binds `design/patterns/validation.md`; the directory name carries the anchor, so the file does not repeat it.
- **Templates** are named for what they emit, not for the directory they sit in. A module directory may hold several (`domain/tables.sql.j2`, `domain/views.sql.j2`), and a name that merely repeats the anchor says nothing about what rendering it produces.
- Anchor names always match `design/` exactly. That symmetry is what lets an agent holding a module name compute the implementation path directly.

---

## Placeholders

Directories reserved but not yet populated are held in git by an empty `.gitkeep` file. There are deliberately **no placeholder templates**: an empty or comment-only `.sql.j2` is indistinguishable from a real one to a renderer, and would silently produce empty SQL. A `.sql.j2` file exists only once it has an implementation.
