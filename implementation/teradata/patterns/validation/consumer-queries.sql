-- Validation: consumer queries (Teradata). Binding of the consumption contract, trust authority,
-- and staleness rules in design/patterns/validation.md §9, §11.
-- {db} is a generic tag, e.g. {Product}_Observability. :trust_producer comes from orientation
-- (trust_authoritative_producer).
--
-- Nothing below withholds use of the product. The map says how far to trust each area and what
-- would raise it; the consumer proceeds and reports what it read (§9: read, select, proceed, disclose).

-- 1. The areas this query plan touches, read BEFORE analytical use.
-- requested_validation_scope is a request-scoped relation (e.g. a volatile table) the caller
-- populates with one (scope_kind, scope_id) row per module, entity, pattern or capability the
-- plan reaches - the areas behind the objects resolved through AccessObject
-- (('MODULE', 'domain'), ('ENTITY', 'domain.Ticket')). Kept as two columns rather than a
-- concatenated 'KIND:id' key so the join uses real column statistics, not a computed string.
-- Driving FROM the caller's own request (LEFT OUTER JOIN to the map, not the map filtered by the
-- request) is what guarantees every requested area gets a row: a plain filter silently drops a
-- scope the map has no entry for, which is the exact failure mode the trust map exists to remove.
-- Rules: a row missing for an area means no-evidence / unknown, not sound;
-- a row whose evidence is stale reads at confidence 'unknown' whatever it recorded;
-- never recount the run's capped JSON blobs.
