"""verify_skill: check that this repository is a well-formed agent skill.

The standards are no longer compiled into skills: the repository *is* the skill, read
progressively through `SKILL.md` and the role files in `roles/`. Nothing is rewritten,
so there is nothing to check for paraphrase or loss. What remains checkable is whether
the package is well formed and whether its routing resolves.

That second one is the check that matters. The failure mode of a routed skill is a
dangling pointer: `SKILL.md` sends an agent to a file that is not there, and the agent
either guesses or gives up. The compiled packages shipped exactly this defect - the
review skill told its agent to run a linter that was not in the bundle - so it is worth
a build gate.

    python tooling/skill/verify_skill.py              # checks this repository
    python tooling/skill/verify_skill.py --root path  # or somewhere else

Exit code is 0 when the package conforms, 1 when it does not, 2 when there is no
SKILL.md to check, so a missing skill is not mistaken for a pass.

Stdlib only, like the tools it sits beside.
